If `col_suffixes` contains \"DESC\", `IndexColumns` adds a space before it.\n\nLet's look at `Columns` class again.\n\n```python\n76\tclass Columns(TableColumns):\n77\t    \"\"\"Hold a reference to one or many columns.\"\"\"\n78\t\n79\t    def __init__(self, table, columns, quote_name, col_suffixes=()):\n80\t        self.quote_name = quote_name\n81\t        self.col_suffixes = col_suffixes\n82\t        super().__init__(table, columns)\n83\t\n84\t    def __str__(self):\n85\t        def col_str(column, idx):\n86\t            try:\n87\t                return self.quote_name(column) + self.col_suffixes[idx]\n88\t            except IndexError:\n89\t                return self.quote_name(column)\n90\t\n91\t        return ', '.join(col_str(column, idx) for idx, column in enumerate(self.columns))\n```\n\nThe issue in `Columns` is that it concatenates `quote_name(column)` and `col_suffixes[idx]` directly. If `col_suffixes[idx]` is \"DESC\", we get `\"name\"DESC`. It should probably check if `col_suffixes[idx]` is not empty and add a space if needed. However, `col_suffixes` might already contain the space if it comes from some parts of Django, but here it seems it doesn't.\n\nThe PR description says:\n> Creating an index through:\n> index = Index(fields=['-name\u2019], name='idx')\n> Will generate the valid but not so pretty CREATE INDEX statement:\n> CREATE INDEX \"idx\" ON \"schema_author\" (\"name\"DESC)\n\nThis implies that `Index` passes `['DESC']` (or similar) as `col_suffixes`.\n\nNow let's look at `IndexColumns`.\n\n```python\n106\tclass IndexColumns(Columns):\n107\t    def __init__(self, table, columns, quote_name, col_suffixes=(), opclasses=()):\n108\t        self.opclasses = opclasses\n109\t        super().__init__(table, columns, quote_name, col_suffixes)\n110\t\n111\t    def __str__(self):\n112\t        def col_str(column, idx):\n113\t            # Index.__init__() guarantees that self.opclasses is the same\n114\t            # length as self.columns.\n115\t            col = '{} {}'.format(self.quote_name(column), self.opclasses[idx])\n116\t            try:\n117\t                col = '{} {}'.format(col, self.col_suffixes[idx])\n118\t            except IndexError:\n119\t                pass\n120\t            return col\n121\t\n122\t        return ', '.join(col_str(column, idx) for idx, column in enumerate(self.columns))\n```\n\nIn `IndexColumns`, line 115 adds a space between column and opclass.\nLine 117 adds a space between `col` and suffix.\n\nIf `col_suffixes[idx]` is empty string `''`, line 117 becomes `col = '{} {}'.format(col, '')`, which appends a space.\n\nSo for `IndexColumns`, we should only append the suffix if it is not empty.\n\nFor `Columns`, we should append the suffix with a space if it is not empty.\n\nLet's verify what `col_suffixes` usually contains. The PR description says:\n> Unfortunately in the fix in #30903 it was assumed that the col_suffixes passed to django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns would be empty for ascending order but instead it will contain empty strings and thus causing this bug.\n\nSo `col_suffixes` can be `['']` or `['DESC']`.\n\nIf I change `Columns.__str__` to add a space:\n\n```python\n            try:\n                suffix = self.col_suffixes[idx]\n                if suffix:\n                    return '{} {}'.format(self.quote_name(column), suffix)\n                return self.quote_name(column)\n            except IndexError:\n                return self.quote_name(column)\n```\n\nAnd `IndexColumns.__str__`:\n\n```python\n            col = '{} {}'.format(self.quote_name(column), self.opclasses[idx])\n            try:\n                suffix = self.col_suffixes[idx]\n                if suffix:\n                    col = '{} {}'.format(col, suffix)\n            except IndexError:\n                pass\n            return col\n```\n\nWait, `IndexColumns` inherits from `Columns`.\n\nIf I modify `Columns`, I should check if `IndexColumns` overrides `__str__`. Yes, it does.\n\nSo I need to modify both.\n\nLet's check `Columns` modification first.\nOriginal:\n```python\n87\t                return self.quote_name(column) + self.col_suffixes[idx]\n```\n\nProposed:\n```python\n                suffix = self.col_suffixes[idx]\n                if suffix:\n                    return '{} {}'.format(self.quote_name(column), suffix)\n                return self.quote_name(column)\n```\n\nIf `suffix` is \"DESC\", it returns `\"name\" DESC`.\nIf `suffix` is \"\", it returns `\"name\"`.\n\nThis seems correct for `Columns`.\n\nNow `IndexColumns`.\nOriginal:\n```python\n115\t            col = '{} {}'.format(self.quote_name(column), self.opclasses[idx])\n116\t            try:\n117\t                col = '{} {}'.format(col, self.col_suffixes[idx])\n118\t            except IndexError:\n119\t                pass\n120\t            return col\n```\n\nProposed:\n```python\n            col = '{} {}'.format(self.quote_name(column), self.opclasses[idx])\n            try:\n                suffix = self.col_suffixes[idx]\n                if suffix:\n                    col = '{} {}'.format(col, suffix)\n            except IndexError:\n                pass\n            return col\n```\n\nIf `opclasses[idx]` is \"text_pattern_ops\" and `suffix` is \"\", `col` starts as `\"name\" text_pattern_ops`. `suffix` is empty, so we don't append anything. Result: `\"name\" text_pattern_ops`. Correct.\n\nIf `opclasses[idx]` is \"text_pattern_ops\" and `suffix` is \"DESC\", `col` starts as `\"name\" text_pattern_ops`. `suffix` is \"DESC\", so we append \" DESC\". Result: `\"name\" text_pattern_ops DESC`. Correct.\n\nWait, what if `opclasses` is empty? `IndexColumns` seems to assume `opclasses` is populated.\nLine 113 says: `# Index.__init__() guarantees that self.opclasses is the same length as self.columns.`\n\nBut what if the opclass string itself is empty?\nIf `opclasses[idx]` is empty string?\n`col = '{} {}'.format(\"name\", \"\")` -> `\"name\" ` (trailing space).\n\nDoes `Index` allow empty opclasses?\nThe `Index` class in Django usually maps fields to opclasses. If no opclass is specified for a field, what is passed?\n\nIf `IndexColumns` is used, it seems `opclasses` are expected.\n\nLet's check where `IndexColumns` is instantiated. It's likely in `django/db/models/indexes.py` or similar.\n\nI'll search for usages of `IndexColumns`.\n\n```bash\ngrep -r \"IndexColumns\" django/\n```",

If `col_suffixes` contains \"DESC\", `IndexColumns` adds a space before it.\n\nLet's look at `Columns` class again.\n\n```python\n76\tclass Columns(TableColumns):\n77\t    \"\"\"Hold a reference to one or many columns.\"\"\"\n78\t\n79\t    def __init__(self, table, columns, quote_name, col_suffixes=()):\n80\t        self.quote_name = quote_name\n81\t        self.col_suffixes = col_suffixes\n82\t        super().__init__(table, columns)\n83\t\n84\t    def __str__(self):\n85\t        def col_str(column, idx):\n86\t            try:\n87\t                return self.quote_name(column) + self.col_suffixes[idx]\n88\t            except IndexError:\n89\t                return self.quote_name(column)\n90\t\n91\t        return ', '.join(col_str(column, idx) for idx, column in enumerate(self.columns))\n```\n\nThe issue in `Columns` is that it concatenates `quote_name(column)` and `col_suffixes[idx]` directly. If `col_suffixes[idx]` is \"DESC\", we get `\"name\"DESC`. It should probably check if `col_suffixes[idx]` is not empty and add a space if needed. However, `col_suffixes` might already contain the space if it comes from some parts of Django, but here it seems it doesn't.\n\nThe PR description says:\n> Creating an index through:\n> index = Index(fields=['-name\u2019], name='idx')\n> Will generate the valid but not so pretty CREATE INDEX statement:\n> CREATE INDEX \"idx\" ON \"schema_author\" (\"name\"DESC)\n\nThis implies that `Index` passes `['DESC']` (or similar) as `col_suffixes`.\n\nNow let's look at `IndexColumns`.\n\n```python\n106\tclass IndexColumns(Columns):\n107\t    def __init__(self, table, columns, quote_name, col_suffixes=(), opclasses=()):\n108\t        self.opclasses = opclasses\n109\t        super().__init__(table, columns, quote_name, col_suffixes)\n110\t\n111\t    def __str__(self):\n112\t        def col_str(column, idx):\n113\t            # Index.__init__() guarantees that self.opclasses is the same\n114\t            # length as self.columns.\n115\t            col = '{} {}'.format(self.quote_name(column), self.opclasses[idx])\n116\t            try:\n117\t                col = '{} {}'.format(col, self.col_suffixes[idx])\n118\t            except IndexError:\n119\t                pass\n120\t            return col\n121\t\n122\t        return ', '.join(col_str(column, idx) for idx, column in enumerate(self.columns))\n```\n\nIn `IndexColumns`, line 115 adds a space between column and opclass.\nLine 117 adds a space between `col` and suffix.\n\nIf `col_suffixes[idx]` is empty string `''`, line 117 becomes `col = '{} {}'.format(col, '')`, which appends a space.\n\nSo for `IndexColumns`, we should only append the suffix if it is not empty.\n\nFor `Columns`, we should append the suffix with a space if it is not empty.\n\nLet's verify what `col_suffixes` usually contains. The PR description says:\n> Unfortunately in the fix in #30903 it was assumed that the col_suffixes passed to django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns would be empty for ascending order but instead it will contain empty strings and thus causing this bug.\n\nSo `col_suffixes` can be `['']` or `['DESC']`.\n\nIf I change `Columns.__str__` to add a space:\n\n```python\n            try:\n                suffix = self.col_suffixes[idx]\n                if suffix:\n                    return '{} {}'.format(self.quote_name(column), suffix)\n                return self.quote_name(column)\n            except IndexError:\n                return self.quote_name(column)\n```\n\nAnd `IndexColumns.__str__`:\n\n```python\n            col = '{} {}'.format(self.quote_name(column), self.opclasses[idx])\n            try:\n                suffix = self.col_suffixes[idx]\n                if suffix:\n                    col = '{} {}'.format(col, suffix)\n            except IndexError:\n                pass\n            return col\n```\n\nWait, `IndexColumns` inherits from `Columns`.\n\nIf I modify `Columns`, I should check if `IndexColumns` overrides `__str__`. Yes, it does.\n\nSo I need to modify both.\n\nLet's check `Columns` modification first.\nOriginal:\n```python\n87\t                return self.quote_name(column) + self.col_suffixes[idx]\n```\n\nProposed:\n```python\n                suffix = self.col_suffixes[idx]\n                if suffix:\n                    return '{} {}'.format(self.quote_name(column), suffix)\n                return self.quote_name(column)\n```\n\nIf `suffix` is \"DESC\", it returns `\"name\" DESC`.\nIf `suffix` is \"\", it returns `\"name\"`.\n\nThis seems correct for `Columns`.\n\nNow `IndexColumns`.\nOriginal:\n```python\n115\t            col = '{} {}'.format(self.quote_name(column), self.opclasses[idx])\n116\t            try:\n117\t                col = '{} {}'.format(col, self.col_suffixes[idx])\n118\t            except IndexError:\n119\t                pass\n120\t            return col\n```\n\nProposed:\n```python\n            col = '{} {}'.format(self.quote_name(column), self.opclasses[idx])\n            try:\n                suffix = self.col_suffixes[idx]\n                if suffix:\n                    col = '{} {}'.format(col, suffix)\n            except IndexError:\n                pass\n            return col\n```\n\nIf `opclasses[idx]` is \"text_pattern_ops\" and `suffix` is \"\", `col` starts as `\"name\" text_pattern_ops`. `suffix` is empty, so we don't append anything. Result: `\"name\" text_pattern_ops`. Correct.\n\nIf `opclasses[idx]` is \"text_pattern_ops\" and `suffix` is \"DESC\", `col` starts as `\"name\" text_pattern_ops`. `suffix` is \"DESC\", so we append \" DESC\". Result: `\"name\" text_pattern_ops DESC`. Correct.\n\nWait, what if `opclasses` is empty? `IndexColumns` seems to assume `opclasses` is populated.\nLine 113 says: `# Index.__init__() guarantees that self.opclasses is the same length as self.columns.`\n\nBut what if the opclass string itself is empty?\nIf `opclasses[idx]` is empty string?\n`col = '{} {}'.format(\"name\", \"\")` -> `\"name\" ` (trailing space).\n\nDoes `Index` allow empty opclasses?\nThe `Index` class in Django usually maps fields to opclasses. If no opclass is specified for a field, what is passed?\n\nIf `IndexColumns` is used, it seems `opclasses` are expected.\n\nLet's check where `IndexColumns` is instantiated. It's likely in `django/db/models/indexes.py` or similar.\n\nI'll search for usages of `IndexColumns`.\n\n```bash\ngrep -r \"IndexColumns\" django/\n```",
