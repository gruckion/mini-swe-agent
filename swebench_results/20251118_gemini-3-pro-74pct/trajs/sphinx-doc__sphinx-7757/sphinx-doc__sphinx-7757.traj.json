But it applies to `posonlyargs + args`.\n\nSo I need to adjust how defaults are assigned.\n\nThe total number of positional arguments is `len(posonlyargs) + len(args)`.\nThe defaults align with the end of this combined list.\n\nLet `n_posonly = len(posonlyargs)`\nLet `n_args = len(args)`\nLet `n_defaults = len(defaults)`\n\nThe defaults start applying from index `(n_posonly + n_args) - n_defaults`.\n\nIf I iterate through `posonlyargs` (index `i` from 0 to `n_posonly - 1`):\nThe argument at index `i` has a default if `i >= (n_posonly + n_args) - n_defaults`.\nThe default value is at `defaults[i - (n_posonly + n_args) + n_defaults]`.\n\nWait, simpler:\nThe list of all positional arguments is `posonlyargs + args`.\nThe list of defaults corresponds to the tail of this list.\n\nSo I should probably iterate over `posonlyargs` and assign defaults if applicable.\n\nIn `sphinx/util/inspect.py`:\n\n```python\n   523\t    if hasattr(args, \"posonlyargs\"):\n   524\t        for arg in args.posonlyargs:  # type: ignore\n   525\t            annotation = ast_unparse(arg.annotation) or Parameter.empty\n   526\t            params.append(Parameter(arg.arg, Parameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY,\n   527\t                                    annotation=annotation))\n```\n\nI need to change this loop to handle defaults.\n\nAnd also the loop for `args.args` needs to be updated because `len(args.defaults)` includes defaults for `posonlyargs`.\n\nCurrently:\n```python\n   530\t        if len(args.args) - i <= len(args.defaults):\n   531\t            default = ast_unparse(args.defaults[-len(args.args) + i])\n```\nThis logic is definitely wrong if `posonlyargs` are present and have defaults.\n\nIf `posonlyargs` are NOT present (Python < 3.8 or just not used), `posonlyargs` is empty list (or attribute missing).\nIf attribute missing, `hasattr` check fails, so we skip the first loop.\nThen `args.args` loop runs. `len(args.args) - i <= len(args.defaults)` works because `defaults` only covers `args`.\n\nBut with `posonlyargs`, `defaults` covers both.\n\nSo I should calculate the offset for defaults.\n\nLet `posonlyargs = args.posonlyargs` (if exists, else [])\nLet `posargs = posonlyargs + args.args`\n\nBut I can't easily concatenate them because they are different AST node types maybe? No, they are both `arg` objects.\n\nHowever, the code iterates them separately.\n\nLet's fix `sphinx/util/inspect.py`.\n\nI need to know how many defaults are consumed by `posonlyargs`.\n\n`defaults` has length `D`.\n`posonlyargs` has length `P`.\n`args` has length `A`.\n\nThe defaults cover the last `D` arguments of the `P + A` sequence.\n\nSo, for `posonlyargs` at index `i` (0-based):\nIt corresponds to index `i` in the combined sequence.\nIt has a default if `i >= (P + A) - D`.\nThe default index in `defaults` list is `i - (P + A) + D`.\n\nFor `args` at index `j` (0-based):\nIt corresponds to index `P + j` in the combined sequence.\nIt has a default if `P + j >= (P + A) - D` => `j >= A - D`.\nThe default index in `defaults` list is `(P + j) - (P + A) + D` => `j - A + D`.\n\nLet's check the existing logic for `args`:\n`len(args.args) - i <= len(args.defaults)`\n`A - i <= D` => `i >= A - D`.\nAnd the index used is `-len(args.args) + i` => `-A + i`.\nWait, `defaults[-A + i]` is equivalent to `defaults[D - A + i]` if we use positive indices?\n`defaults` has length `D`.\n`defaults[i - A + D]` is what I derived.\n`defaults[i - A]` (negative index) would be `defaults[D + i - A]`.\nYes, it matches.\n\nBUT, this existing logic assumes `D` only counts defaults for `args`.\nIf `D` includes defaults for `posonlyargs`, then `D` can be larger than `A`.\nIf `D > A`, then `defaults[-A + i]` is valid but might point to the wrong default if we are not careful?\nActually `defaults` is a list. `defaults[-k]` gets the k-th element from the end.\n`defaults` contains `[def_b, def_c]` in my example. `D=2`. `P=2` (a, b), `A=1` (c).\n`posonlyargs`: a (idx 0), b (idx 1).\n`args`: c (idx 0).\n\nFor `c` (j=0):\n`j >= A - D` => `0 >= 1 - 2` => `0 >= -1`. True.\nIndex: `j - A + D` => `0 - 1 + 2` = 1.\n`defaults[1]` is `def_c`. Correct.\n\nExisting logic:\n`A - j <= D` => `1 - 0 <= 2`. True.\nIndex: `-A + j` => `-1 + 0` = -1.\n`defaults[-1]` is the last element, which is `def_c`. Correct.\n\nSo the logic for `args` loop MIGHT be correct IF we assume `defaults` aligns with the end of `args`.\nBUT `defaults` aligns with the end of `posonlyargs + args`.\n\nIf `posonlyargs` has defaults, then `D` is large.\nIn my example: `defaults` = `[0, 1]`.\n`args` loop for `c` (j=0):\n`defaults[-1]` is `1`. Correct.\n\nWhat if `posonlyargs` has NO defaults, but `args` has defaults?\n`def foo(a, /, b=1): ...`\n`P=1` (a), `A=1` (b). `D=1` (1).\n`posonlyargs`: a (i=0). `i >= 1 + 1 - 1` => `0 >= 1`. False. No default.\n`args`: b (j=0). `j >= 1 - 1` => `0 >= 0`. True.\nIndex `j - A + D` => `0 - 1 + 1` = 0. `defaults[0]` is 1.\nExisting logic: `defaults[-1]` is 1. Correct.\n\nWhat if `posonlyargs` has defaults, and `args` has defaults?\n`def foo(a=1, /, b=2): ...`\n`P=1`, `A=1`, `D=2`.\n`posonlyargs`: a (i=0). `i >= 1 + 1 - 2` => `0 >= 0`. True.\nIndex `i - (P + A) + D` => `0 - 2 + 2` = 0. `defaults[0]` is 1.\n`args`: b (j=0). `j >= 1 - 2` => `0 >= -1`. True.\nIndex `j - A + D` => `0 - 1 + 2` = 1. `defaults[1]` is 2.\nExisting logic for `args`: `defaults[-1]` is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the existing logic for `args` loop seems to work correctly because `defaults` are always at the end of the combined list, and `args` are at the end of the combined list. So `defaults[-1]` is always the last arg's default, `defaults[-2]` is the second to last, etc.\n\nThe problem is that `posonlyargs` loop DOES NOT assign defaults.\n\nSo I need to update `posonlyargs` loop to assign defaults.\n\nI need to calculate `P` and `A`.\n`P = len(args.posonlyargs)`\n`A = len(args.args)`\n`D = len(args.defaults)`\n\nFor `posonlyargs` at index `i`:\nIf `(P + A) - i <= D`:\n    It has a default.\n    The default is at `defaults[i - (P + A)]` (using negative indexing).\n    Or `defaults[i - (P + A) + D]` (using positive indexing).\n\nLet's verify negative indexing.\n`defaults` has length `D`.\nWe want the default corresponding to position `i` in the combined list of length `P+A`.\nThe defaults start at index `(P+A) - D` in the combined list.\nSo if `i >= (P+A) - D`, we have a default.\nThe offset into `defaults` is `i - ((P+A) - D)`.\nUsing negative indexing relative to `defaults` end?\nThe element is at `i - (P+A)` from the end?\nExample: `def foo(a, b=0, /, c=1)`. `P=2`, `A=1`, `D=2`.\n`a` (i=0): `0 >= 3 - 2` => `0 >= 1`.

But it applies to `posonlyargs + args`.\n\nSo I need to adjust how defaults are assigned.\n\nThe total number of positional arguments is `len(posonlyargs) + len(args)`.\nThe defaults align with the end of this combined list.\n\nLet `n_posonly = len(posonlyargs)`\nLet `n_args = len(args)`\nLet `n_defaults = len(defaults)`\n\nThe defaults start applying from index `(n_posonly + n_args) - n_defaults`.\n\nIf I iterate through `posonlyargs` (index `i` from 0 to `n_posonly - 1`):\nThe argument at index `i` has a default if `i >= (n_posonly + n_args) - n_defaults`.\nThe default value is at `defaults[i - (n_posonly + n_args) + n_defaults]`.\n\nWait, simpler:\nThe list of all positional arguments is `posonlyargs + args`.\nThe list of defaults corresponds to the tail of this list.\n\nSo I should probably iterate over `posonlyargs` and assign defaults if applicable.\n\nIn `sphinx/util/inspect.py`:\n\n```python\n   523\t    if hasattr(args, \"posonlyargs\"):\n   524\t        for arg in args.posonlyargs:  # type: ignore\n   525\t            annotation = ast_unparse(arg.annotation) or Parameter.empty\n   526\t            params.append(Parameter(arg.arg, Parameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY,\n   527\t                                    annotation=annotation))\n```\n\nI need to change this loop to handle defaults.\n\nAnd also the loop for `args.args` needs to be updated because `len(args.defaults)` includes defaults for `posonlyargs`.\n\nCurrently:\n```python\n   530\t        if len(args.args) - i <= len(args.defaults):\n   531\t            default = ast_unparse(args.defaults[-len(args.args) + i])\n```\nThis logic is definitely wrong if `posonlyargs` are present and have defaults.\n\nIf `posonlyargs` are NOT present (Python < 3.8 or just not used), `posonlyargs` is empty list (or attribute missing).\nIf attribute missing, `hasattr` check fails, so we skip the first loop.\nThen `args.args` loop runs. `len(args.args) - i <= len(args.defaults)` works because `defaults` only covers `args`.\n\nBut with `posonlyargs`, `defaults` covers both.\n\nSo I should calculate the offset for defaults.\n\nLet `posonlyargs = args.posonlyargs` (if exists, else [])\nLet `posargs = posonlyargs + args.args`\n\nBut I can't easily concatenate them because they are different AST node types maybe? No, they are both `arg` objects.\n\nHowever, the code iterates them separately.\n\nLet's fix `sphinx/util/inspect.py`.\n\nI need to know how many defaults are consumed by `posonlyargs`.\n\n`defaults` has length `D`.\n`posonlyargs` has length `P`.\n`args` has length `A`.\n\nThe defaults cover the last `D` arguments of the `P + A` sequence.\n\nSo, for `posonlyargs` at index `i` (0-based):\nIt corresponds to index `i` in the combined sequence.\nIt has a default if `i >= (P + A) - D`.\nThe default index in `defaults` list is `i - (P + A) + D`.\n\nFor `args` at index `j` (0-based):\nIt corresponds to index `P + j` in the combined sequence.\nIt has a default if `P + j >= (P + A) - D` => `j >= A - D`.\nThe default index in `defaults` list is `(P + j) - (P + A) + D` => `j - A + D`.\n\nLet's check the existing logic for `args`:\n`len(args.args) - i <= len(args.defaults)`\n`A - i <= D` => `i >= A - D`.\nAnd the index used is `-len(args.args) + i` => `-A + i`.\nWait, `defaults[-A + i]` is equivalent to `defaults[D - A + i]` if we use positive indices?\n`defaults` has length `D`.\n`defaults[i - A + D]` is what I derived.\n`defaults[i - A]` (negative index) would be `defaults[D + i - A]`.\nYes, it matches.\n\nBUT, this existing logic assumes `D` only counts defaults for `args`.\nIf `D` includes defaults for `posonlyargs`, then `D` can be larger than `A`.\nIf `D > A`, then `defaults[-A + i]` is valid but might point to the wrong default if we are not careful?\nActually `defaults` is a list. `defaults[-k]` gets the k-th element from the end.\n`defaults` contains `[def_b, def_c]` in my example. `D=2`. `P=2` (a, b), `A=1` (c).\n`posonlyargs`: a (idx 0), b (idx 1).\n`args`: c (idx 0).\n\nFor `c` (j=0):\n`j >= A - D` => `0 >= 1 - 2` => `0 >= -1`. True.\nIndex: `j - A + D` => `0 - 1 + 2` = 1.\n`defaults[1]` is `def_c`. Correct.\n\nExisting logic:\n`A - j <= D` => `1 - 0 <= 2`. True.\nIndex: `-A + j` => `-1 + 0` = -1.\n`defaults[-1]` is the last element, which is `def_c`. Correct.\n\nSo the logic for `args` loop MIGHT be correct IF we assume `defaults` aligns with the end of `args`.\nBUT `defaults` aligns with the end of `posonlyargs + args`.\n\nIf `posonlyargs` has defaults, then `D` is large.\nIn my example: `defaults` = `[0, 1]`.\n`args` loop for `c` (j=0):\n`defaults[-1]` is `1`. Correct.\n\nWhat if `posonlyargs` has NO defaults, but `args` has defaults?\n`def foo(a, /, b=1): ...`\n`P=1` (a), `A=1` (b). `D=1` (1).\n`posonlyargs`: a (i=0). `i >= 1 + 1 - 1` => `0 >= 1`. False. No default.\n`args`: b (j=0). `j >= 1 - 1` => `0 >= 0`. True.\nIndex `j - A + D` => `0 - 1 + 1` = 0. `defaults[0]` is 1.\nExisting logic: `defaults[-1]` is 1. Correct.\n\nWhat if `posonlyargs` has defaults, and `args` has defaults?\n`def foo(a=1, /, b=2): ...`\n`P=1`, `A=1`, `D=2`.\n`posonlyargs`: a (i=0). `i >= 1 + 1 - 2` => `0 >= 0`. True.\nIndex `i - (P + A) + D` => `0 - 2 + 2` = 0. `defaults[0]` is 1.\n`args`: b (j=0). `j >= 1 - 2` => `0 >= -1`. True.\nIndex `j - A + D` => `0 - 1 + 2` = 1. `defaults[1]` is 2.\nExisting logic for `args`: `defaults[-1]` is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the existing logic for `args` loop seems to work correctly because `defaults` are always at the end of the combined list, and `args` are at the end of the combined list. So `defaults[-1]` is always the last arg's default, `defaults[-2]` is the second to last, etc.\n\nThe problem is that `posonlyargs` loop DOES NOT assign defaults.\n\nSo I need to update `posonlyargs` loop to assign defaults.\n\nI need to calculate `P` and `A`.\n`P = len(args.posonlyargs)`\n`A = len(args.args)`\n`D = len(args.defaults)`\n\nFor `posonlyargs` at index `i`:\nIf `(P + A) - i <= D`:\n    It has a default.\n    The default is at `defaults[i - (P + A)]` (using negative indexing).\n    Or `defaults[i - (P + A) + D]` (using positive indexing).\n\nLet's verify negative indexing.\n`defaults` has length `D`.\nWe want the default corresponding to position `i` in the combined list of length `P+A`.\nThe defaults start at index `(P+A) - D` in the combined list.\nSo if `i >= (P+A) - D`, we have a default.\nThe offset into `defaults` is `i - ((P+A) - D)`.\nUsing negative indexing relative to `defaults` end?\nThe element is at `i - (P+A)` from the end?\nExample: `def foo(a, b=0, /, c=1)`. `P=2`, `A=1`, `D=2`.\n`a` (i=0): `0 >= 3 - 2` => `0 >= 1`. False.\n`b` (i=1): `1 >= 3 - 2` => `1 >= 1`. True.\nIndex in defaults: `1 - (3 - 2) = 0`. `defaults[0]` is 0.\nNegative index: `1 - 3 = -2`. `defaults[-2]` is 0. Correct.\n\nSo the formula `defaults[i - (P + A)]` works.\n\nSo I need to modify `sphinx/util/inspect.py`.\n\nI need to import `Parameter` inside `signature_from_str` or ensure it is available. It is imported from `inspect`.\n\nI will modify `sphinx/util/inspect.py`.\n\n```python\n<<<<\n    if hasattr(args, \"posonlyargs\"):\n        for arg in args.posonlyargs:  # type: ignore\n            annotation = ast_unparse(arg.annotation) or Parameter.empty\n            params.append(Parameter(arg.arg, Parameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY,\n                                    annotation=annotation))\n====\n    if hasattr(args, \"posonlyargs\"):\n        posonlyargs = args.posonlyargs  # type: ignore\n        for i, arg in enumerate(posonlyargs):\n            annotation = ast_unparse(arg.annotation) or Parameter.empty\n            \n            default = Parameter.empty\n            if len(args.defaults) >= len(posonlyargs) + len(args.args) - i:\n                 default = ast_unparse(args.defaults[i - (len(posonlyargs) + len(args.args))])\n\n            params.append(Parameter(arg.arg, Parameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY,\n                                    default=default, annotation=annotation))\n>>>>\n```\n\nWait, `len(args.defaults) >= len(posonlyargs) + len(args.args) - i`\n`D >= P + A - i`\n`i >= P + A - D`.\nThis matches my condition `i >= (P+A) - D`.\n\nAnd the index: `i - (len(posonlyargs) + len(args.args))`\n`i - (P + A)`.\nThis matches my negative index derivation.\n\nOne detail: `args.defaults` contains AST nodes, so I need to `ast_unparse` them.\n\nAlso, I should check if `args.args` loop needs adjustment.\nThe existing logic:\n```python\n   530\t        if len(args.args) - i <= len(args.defaults):\n   531\t            default = ast_unparse(args.defaults[-len(args.args) + i])\n```\nHere `i` is the index within `args.args`.\nLet's call it `j`.\n`A - j <= D`.\nIndex: `-A + j`.\n\nMy derivation for `args` (j):\n`j >= A - D` => `D >= A - j`.

They are lists. So `+` should work.\nBut `args.args` is a list of `arg` nodes. `posonlyargs` is also a list of `arg` nodes.\n\nLet's verify `posonlyargs` type.\nIn my `check_ast.py`:\n`args.posonlyargs` is a list.\n`args.args` is a list.\n\nSo `posargs` will be a combined list.\n`len(posargs)` is `P + A`.\n`len(defaults)` is `D`.\n\nCondition: `len(posargs) - i <= len(defaults)`\n`(P + A) - i <= D`\n`i >= P + A - D`. Correct.\n\nIndex: `-len(posargs) + i`\n`-(P + A) + i`\n`i - (P + A)`. Correct.\n\nSo this logic is consistent with the one used for `args.args` if we consider the full list of positional args.\n\nHowever, I should probably not modify `args.args` loop logic, or maybe I should?\nThe `args.args` loop uses `len(args.args) - i <= len(args.defaults)`.\nThis is `A - j <= D`.\nThis is correct ONLY if `D <= A`.\nIf `D > A` (meaning some defaults are for `posonlyargs`), then `A - j <= D` is always true (since `j < A` and `A - j >= 1`).\nWait.\nIf `D > A`, then `A - j <= D` is true.\nIndex: `-A + j`.\nIf `D > A`, `defaults[-A + j]` will access the last `A` defaults.\nBut `defaults` has `D` elements.\n`defaults[-A + j]` corresponds to index `D - A + j` (positive).\nThis means it skips the first `D - A` defaults.\nThe first `D - A` defaults are exactly those for `posonlyargs` (since `D` covers the tail of `P + A`).\nSo `defaults` for `args` are indeed the last `A` defaults (or fewer if `D < A`).\nSo the existing logic for `args.args` is correct even if `D > A`.\n\nExample: `def foo(a, b=0, /, c=1)`. `P=2`, `A=1`, `D=2`.\n`args` loop (c, j=0).\n`A - j = 1 - 0 = 1`. `D = 2`. `1 <= 2`.

Correct.\n\nSo I only need to fix `posonlyargs` loop.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '523,527c\\    if hasattr(args, \"posonlyargs\"):\\n        posonlyargs = args.posonlyargs  # type: ignore\\n        posargs = posonlyargs + args.args\\n        defaults = args.defaults\\n        for i, arg in enumerate(posonlyargs):\\n            if len(posargs) - i <= len(defaults):\\n                default = ast_unparse(defaults[-len(posargs) + i])\\n            else:\\n                default = Parameter.empty\\n\\n            annotation = ast_unparse(arg.annotation) or Parameter.empty\\n            params.append(Parameter(arg.arg, Parameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY,\\n                                    default=default, annotation=annotation))' sphinx/util/inspect.py\n```\n\nWait, `ast_unparse` is imported?\nIt is used in the file.\nLine 525: `annotation = ast_unparse(arg.annotation) or Parameter.empty`\nSo it is available.\n\nOne thing: `args.defaults` might not be available if I don't assign it to a variable or access it via `args`.\nIn my proposed code: `defaults = args.defaults`.\n\nLet's double check indentation.\nThe original code:\n```python\n   523\t    if hasattr(args, \"posonlyargs\"):\n   524\t        for arg in args.posonlyargs:  # type: ignore\n   525\t            annotation = ast_unparse(arg.annotation) or Parameter.empty\n   526\t            params.append(Parameter(arg.arg, Parameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY,\n   527\t                                    annotation=annotation))\n```\nIndentation is 4 spaces.\n\nMy replacement:\n```python\n    if hasattr(args, \"posonlyargs\"):\n        posonlyargs = args.posonlyargs  # type: ignore\n        posargs = posonlyargs + args.args\n        defaults = args.defaults\n        for i, arg in enumerate(posonlyargs):\n            if len(posargs) - i <= len(defaults):\n                default = ast_unparse(defaults[-len(posargs) + i])\n            else:\n                default = Parameter.empty\n\n            annotation = ast_unparse(arg.annotation) or Parameter.empty\n            params.append(Parameter(arg.arg, Parameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY,\n                                    default=default, annotation=annotation))\n```\n\nThis looks correct.\n\nOne potential issue: `args.args` might be modified later?
