If `_MockObject` is used as a base class, `__new__` might be called.\n\n2. `_MockObject.__getitem__`:\n   ```python\n   def __getitem__(self, key: str) -> \"_MockObject\":\n       return _make_subclass(key, self.__display_name__, self.__class__)()\n   ```\n   Here `key` is passed as `name`.\n\n3. `_MockObject.__getattr__`:\n   ```python\n   def __getattr__(self, key: str) -> \"_MockObject\":\n       return _make_subclass(key, self.__display_name__, self.__class__)()\n   ```\n   Here `key` is passed as `name`.\n\n4. `_MockModule.__getattr__`:\n   ```python\n   def __getattr__(self, name: str) -> _MockObject:\n       return _make_subclass(name, self.__name__)()\n   ```\n\nThe issue mentions \"generically-typed class\".\n\nIf I have:\n```python\nfrom typing import TypeVar, Generic\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\nclass MyClass(Generic[T]):\n    pass\n```\n\nIf `Generic[T]` is somehow involving `_MockObject`, maybe `__getitem__` is called?\n\nIf I mock a module `foo`, then `foo.Bar` is a `_MockObject`.\nIf I do `foo.Bar[T]`, then `_MockObject.__getitem__` is called with `T`.\n\n`T` is a `TypeVar`. `TypeVar` has a `__repr__` or `__str__` but it is not a string.\n\nIf `foo.Bar` is a `_MockObject`, `foo.Bar[T]` calls `__getitem__(self, key)`. `key` will be `T`.\n\nThen `_make_subclass(key, ...)` is called. `key` is `T`.\n\nInside `_make_subclass(name, module, ...)`:\n`attrs = {'__module__': module, '__display_name__': module + '.' + name}`\n\nIf `name` is `T` (a `TypeVar`), `module + '.' + name` will try to add string and TypeVar, which raises TypeError.\n\nLet's verify this hypothesis with a script.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > reproduce_issue.py\nimport sys\nfrom typing import TypeVar\nfrom sphinx.ext.autodoc.mock import _MockObject\n\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\n\n# Simulate what happens when we access a mocked object with a TypeVar\n# e.g. MockedClass[T]\nmock_obj = _MockObject()\ntry:\n    # This should trigger __getitem__ which calls _make_subclass\n    result = mock_obj[T]\n    print(\"Success\")\nexcept TypeError as e:\n    print(f\"Caught expected TypeError: {e}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Caught unexpected exception: {type(e).__name__}: {e}\")\nEOF\n```",

No, `type.__new__` is called if it's a metaclass.\n   \n   Wait, `_MockObject` is a class.\n   \n   ```python\n    def __new__(cls, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:\n        if len(args) == 3 and isinstance(args[1], tuple):\n            superclass = args[1][-1].__class__\n            if superclass is cls:\n                # subclassing MockObject\n                return _make_subclass(args[0], superclass.__display_name__,\n                                      superclass=superclass, attributes=args[2])\n\n        return super().__new__(cls)\n   ```\n   \n   This looks like it handles the case where `_MockObject` is used as a metaclass? Or maybe when `type(name, bases, attrs)` is called and `bases` contains `_MockObject`?\n   \n   If I do:\n   ```python\n   class MyMock(_MockObject):\n       pass\n   ```\n   `MyMock` is created. `_MockObject.__new__` is NOT called for class creation unless `_MockObject` is a metaclass. But `_MockObject` does not inherit from `type`.\n   \n   However, if `_MockObject` is returned by `mock_imports`, maybe it behaves like a metaclass?\n   \n   The comment says `# subclassing MockObject`.\n   \n   If `_MockObject` is used as a base class, `__new__` is called when instantiating the subclass.\n   \n   But the code checks `len(args) == 3` and `isinstance(args[1], tuple)`. This is the signature of `type(name, bases, dict)`.\n   \n   So if `_MockObject` is used as a metaclass, `__new__` would be called with these args.\n   \n   If `_MockObject` is used as a metaclass, `args[0]` is the class name (string). So `str(name)` is fine.\n\n2. `_MockObject.__getitem__`: `key` is passed. Can be anything. `str(key)` fixes the issue.\n\n3. `_MockObject.__getattr__`: `key` is passed. Usually string. `str(key)` is fine.\n\n4. `_MockModule.__getattr__`: `name` is passed. Usually string. `str(name)` is fine.\n\nSo the fix seems correct and safe.\n\nI'll create a more comprehensive test script to check other types as well, just to be sure.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > test_fix.py\nimport sys\nfrom typing import TypeVar, List\nfrom sphinx.ext.autodoc.mock import _MockObject\n\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\n\nmock_obj = _MockObject()\n\ndef test_getitem(key, description):\n    try:\n        result = mock_obj[key]\n        print(f\"Success: {description}\")\n        # Verify the name of the created class\n        print(f\"  Class name: {result.__class__.__name__}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed: {description} with {e}\")\n\ntest_getitem(T, \"TypeVar\")\ntest_getitem(123, \"Integer\")\ntest_getitem(slice(1, 2), \"Slice\")\ntest_getitem(\"some_string\", \"String\")\ntest_getitem((1, 2), \"Tuple\")\n\n# Test List[T] behavior if possible. \n# List[T] usually returns a specialized type from typing module, \n# but if we mock List, it might be different.\n# But here we are testing _MockObject behavior.\n\nEOF\n```",

No, `type.__new__` is called if it's a metaclass.\n   \n   Wait, `_MockObject` is a class.\n   \n   ```python\n    def __new__(cls, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:\n        if len(args) == 3 and isinstance(args[1], tuple):\n            superclass = args[1][-1].__class__\n            if superclass is cls:\n                # subclassing MockObject\n                return _make_subclass(args[0], superclass.__display_name__,\n                                      superclass=superclass, attributes=args[2])\n\n        return super().__new__(cls)\n   ```\n   \n   This looks like it handles the case where `_MockObject` is used as a metaclass? Or maybe when `type(name, bases, attrs)` is called and `bases` contains `_MockObject`?\n   \n   If I do:\n   ```python\n   class MyMock(_MockObject):\n       pass\n   ```\n   `MyMock` is created. `_MockObject.__new__` is NOT called for class creation unless `_MockObject` is a metaclass. But `_MockObject` does not inherit from `type`.\n   \n   However, if `_MockObject` is returned by `mock_imports`, maybe it behaves like a metaclass?\n   \n   The comment says `# subclassing MockObject`.\n   \n   If `_MockObject` is used as a base class, `__new__` is called when instantiating the subclass.\n   \n   But the code checks `len(args) == 3` and `isinstance(args[1], tuple)`. This is the signature of `type(name, bases, dict)`.\n   \n   So if `_MockObject` is used as a metaclass, `__new__` would be called with these args.\n   \n   If `_MockObject` is used as a metaclass, `args[0]` is the class name (string). So `str(name)` is fine.\n\n2. `_MockObject.__getitem__`: `key` is passed. Can be anything. `str(key)` fixes the issue.\n\n3. `_MockObject.__getattr__`: `key` is passed. Usually string. `str(key)` is fine.\n\n4. `_MockModule.__getattr__`: `name` is passed. Usually string. `str(name)` is fine.\n\nSo the fix seems correct and safe.\n\nI'll create a more comprehensive test script to check other types as well, just to be sure.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > test_fix.py\nimport sys\nfrom typing import TypeVar, List\nfrom sphinx.ext.autodoc.mock import _MockObject\n\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\n\nmock_obj = _MockObject()\n\ndef test_getitem(key, description):\n    try:\n        result = mock_obj[key]\n        print(f\"Success: {description}\")\n        # Verify the name of the created class\n        print(f\"  Class name: {result.__class__.__name__}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed: {description} with {e}\")\n\ntest_getitem(T, \"TypeVar\")\ntest_getitem(123, \"Integer\")\ntest_getitem(slice(1, 2), \"Slice\")\ntest_getitem(\"some_string\", \"String\")\ntest_getitem((1, 2), \"Tuple\")\n\n# Test List[T] behavior if possible. \n# List[T] usually returns a specialized type from typing module, \n# but if we mock List, it might be different.\n# But here we are testing _MockObject behavior.\n\nEOF\n```",
