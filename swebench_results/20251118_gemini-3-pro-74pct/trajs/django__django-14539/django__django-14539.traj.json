      "content": "THOUGHT: The reproduction script confirms the issue. The actual output has `lt!` at the end instead of `!`.\n\nThe issue is indeed in this block:\n\n```python\n            middle_unescaped = html.unescape(middle)\n            stripped = middle_unescaped.rstrip(TRAILING_PUNCTUATION_CHARS)\n            if middle_unescaped != stripped:\n                trail = middle[len(stripped):] + trail\n                middle = middle[:len(stripped) - len(middle_unescaped)]\n                trimmed_something = True\n```\n\nWe are trying to find out how much punctuation was stripped from the end of `middle_unescaped`, and then remove the corresponding characters from `middle`.\n\n`middle_unescaped` is `google.com/?q=1<!`\n`stripped` is `google.com/?q=1<`\nThe difference is `!` at the end.\n\nWe want to remove `!` from the end of `middle` (`google.com/?q=1&lt!`).\n\nThe current code calculates indices based on lengths of unescaped strings, which doesn't map to indices in the escaped string `middle`.\n\n`len(stripped)` is 16.\n`len(middle_unescaped)` is 17.\n\n`middle[16:]` -> `lt!` (because `middle` is `google.com/?q=1&lt!`, length 21).\n`middle[:16-17]` -> `middle[:-1]` -> `google.com/?q=1&lt`.\n\nSo `trail` gets `lt!` and `middle` gets `google.com/?q=1&lt`.\nWhen combined, we get `google.com/?q=1&lt` + `lt!`.\n\nWe need a way to determine how many characters to strip from `middle` based on what was stripped from `middle_unescaped`.\n\nIf `middle_unescaped` ends with some punctuation characters that were stripped, we should look for those characters at the end of `middle`.\n\nHowever, `middle` might contain entities. `html.unescape` handles entities.\n\nIf `middle` ends with `&lt;`, unescaped it is `<`. If `<` is in `TRAILING_PUNCTUATION_CHARS` (it is not), it would be stripped.\n\nIn the example, `!` is stripped. `!` is not an entity.\n\nThe problem is that `html.unescape` changes the length of the string if there are entities.\n\nIf we strip characters from the end of `middle_unescaped`, we need to find the corresponding suffix in `middle`.\n\nLet `punctuation_stripped = middle_unescaped[len(stripped):]`.\nThis is the string of characters that were removed.\n\nIn the example, `punctuation_stripped` is `!`.\n\nWe need to remove `!` from the end of `middle`.\n\nBut what if the stripped punctuation was part of an entity?\n`TRAILING_PUNCTUATION_CHARS` = `.,:;!`\n\nNone of these characters are typically part of an entity name, but `;` is the terminator of an entity.\n\nIf `middle` is `foo&gt;`, unescaped is `foo>`. `>` is not punctuation.\nIf `middle` is `foo;`, unescaped is `foo;`. `;` is punctuation. Stripped: `foo`. Removed: `;`.\n`middle` should become `foo`.\n\nIf `middle` is `foo&nbsp;`, unescaped is `foo` (non-breaking space). ` ` is not punctuation.\n\nIf `middle` is `foo&lt;`, unescaped is `foo<`. Not punctuation.\n\nThe comment says:\n```python\n            # Trim trailing punctuation (after trimming wrapping punctuation,\n            # as encoded entities contain ';'). Unescape entities to avoid\n            # breaking them by removing ';'.\n```\n\nThis suggests that if we have `foo&lt;`, we don't want to strip `;` from the end because it's part of `&lt;`.\n`html.unescape('foo&lt;')` -> `foo<`. `rstrip` won't remove `<`. So `middle_unescaped == stripped`. Nothing happens. Correct.\n\nIf we have `foo;`, `html.unescape('foo;')` -> `foo;`. `rstrip` removes `;`. `stripped` is `foo`.\n`punctuation_stripped` is `;`.\nWe want to remove `;` from `foo;`.\n\nIf we have `foo&lt;!`, unescaped is `foo<!`. `rstrip` removes `!`. `stripped` is `foo<`.\n`punctuation_stripped` is `!`.\nWe want to remove `!` from `foo&lt;!`.\n\nSo, it seems we should look at `punctuation_stripped` and try to remove that from the end of `middle`.\n\nBut wait, `punctuation_stripped` comes from the unescaped string.\nIf `middle` is `foo&#33;` (which is `!`), unescaped is `foo!`.\n`stripped` is `foo`. `punctuation_stripped` is `!`.\nWe want to remove `&#33;` from `middle`.\n\nSo we can't just look for `punctuation_stripped` at the end of `middle`.\n\nHowever, `TRAILING_PUNCTUATION_CHARS` are `.,:;!`.\nThese are ASCII characters.\nIf they are encoded in `middle`, they would look like `&#33;` or `&excl;` etc.\n\nDoes `urlize` receive text that has already been HTML-escaped?\nThe example input is `urlize('Search for google.com/?q=1&lt! and see.')`.\nHere `&lt` is not a valid entity because it misses `;`. But browsers often handle it.\n`html.unescape('google.com/?q=1&lt!')` -> `google.com/?q=1<!`.\nWait, `html.unescape` handles `&lt` without `;`?\n\nLet's check python's `html.unescape` behavior.\n\n```bash\npython3 -c \"import html; print(html.unescape('google.com/?q=1&lt!'))\"\n```",

The actual output has `lt!` at the end instead of `!`.\n\nThe issue is indeed in this block:\n\n```python\n            middle_unescaped = html.unescape(middle)\n            stripped = middle_unescaped.rstrip(TRAILING_PUNCTUATION_CHARS)\n            if middle_unescaped != stripped:\n                trail = middle[len(stripped):] + trail\n                middle = middle[:len(stripped) - len(middle_unescaped)]\n                trimmed_something = True\n```\n\nWe are trying to find out how much punctuation was stripped from the end of `middle_unescaped`, and then remove the corresponding characters from `middle`.\n\n`middle_unescaped` is `google.com/?q=1<!`\n`stripped` is `google.com/?q=1<`\nThe difference is `!` at the end.\n\nWe want to remove `!` from the end of `middle` (`google.com/?q=1&lt!`).\n\nThe current code calculates indices based on lengths of unescaped strings, which doesn't map to indices in the escaped string `middle`.\n\n`len(stripped)` is 16.\n`len(middle_unescaped)` is 17.\n\n`middle[16:]` -> `lt!` (because `middle` is `google.com/?q=1&lt!`, length 21).\n`middle[:16-17]` -> `middle[:-1]` -> `google.com/?q=1&lt`.\n\nSo `trail` gets `lt!` and `middle` gets `google.com/?q=1&lt`.\nWhen combined, we get `google.com/?q=1&lt` + `lt!`.\n\nWe need a way to determine how many characters to strip from `middle` based on what was stripped from `middle_unescaped`.\n\nIf `middle_unescaped` ends with some punctuation characters that were stripped, we should look for those characters at the end of `middle`.\n\nHowever, `middle` might contain entities. `html.unescape` handles entities.\n\nIf `middle` ends with `&lt;`, unescaped it is `<`. If `<` is in `TRAILING_PUNCTUATION_CHARS` (it is not), it would be stripped.\n\nIn the example, `!` is stripped. `!` is not an entity.\n\nThe problem is that `html.unescape` changes the length of the string if there are entities.\n\nIf we strip characters from the end of `middle_unescaped`, we need to find the corresponding suffix in `middle`.\n\nLet `punctuation_stripped = middle_unescaped[len(stripped):]`.\nThis is the string of characters that were removed.\n\nIn the example, `punctuation_stripped` is `!`.\n\nWe need to remove `!` from the end of `middle`.\n\nBut what if the stripped punctuation was part of an entity?\n`TRAILING_PUNCTUATION_CHARS` = `.,:;!`\n\nNone of these characters are typically part of an entity name, but `;` is the terminator of an entity.\n\nIf `middle` is `foo&gt;`, unescaped is `foo>`. `>` is not punctuation.\nIf `middle` is `foo;`, unescaped is `foo;`. `;` is punctuation. Stripped: `foo`. Removed: `;`.\n`middle` should become `foo`.\n\nIf `middle` is `foo&nbsp;`, unescaped is `foo` (non-breaking space). ` ` is not punctuation.\n\nIf `middle` is `foo&lt;`, unescaped is `foo<`. Not punctuation.\n\nThe comment says:\n```python\n            # Trim trailing punctuation (after trimming wrapping punctuation,\n            # as encoded entities contain ';'). Unescape entities to avoid\n            # breaking them by removing ';'.\n```\n\nThis suggests that if we have `foo&lt;`, we don't want to strip `;` from the end because it's part of `&lt;`.\n`html.unescape('foo&lt;')` -> `foo<`. `rstrip` won't remove `<`. So `middle_unescaped == stripped`. Nothing happens. Correct.\n\nIf we have `foo;`, `html.unescape('foo;')` -> `foo;`. `rstrip` removes `;`. `stripped` is `foo`.\n`punctuation_stripped` is `;`.\nWe want to remove `;` from `foo;`.\n\nIf we have `foo&lt;!`, unescaped is `foo<!`. `rstrip` removes `!`. `stripped` is `foo<`.\n`punctuation_stripped` is `!`.\nWe want to remove `!` from `foo&lt;!`.\n\nSo, it seems we should look at `punctuation_stripped` and try to remove that from the end of `middle`.\n\nBut wait, `punctuation_stripped` comes from the unescaped string.\nIf `middle` is `foo&#33;` (which is `!`), unescaped is `foo!`.\n`stripped` is `foo`. `punctuation_stripped` is `!`.\nWe want to remove `&#33;` from `middle`.\n\nSo we can't just look for `punctuation_stripped` at the end of `middle`.\n\nHowever, `TRAILING_PUNCTUATION_CHARS` are `.,:;!`.\nThese are ASCII characters.\nIf they are encoded in `middle`, they would look like `&#33;` or `&excl;` etc.\n\nDoes `urlize` receive text that has already been HTML-escaped?\nThe example input is `urlize('Search for google.com/?q=1&lt! and see.')`.\nHere `&lt` is not a valid entity because it misses `;`. But browsers often handle it.\n`html.unescape('google.com/?q=1&lt!')` -> `google.com/?q=1<!`.\nWait, `html.unescape` handles `&lt` without `;`?\n\nLet's check python's `html.unescape` behavior.\n\n```bash\npython3 -c \"import html; print(html.unescape('google.com/?q=1&lt!'))\"\n```",

This is completely wrong because `stripped` is unescaped.\n\nWe need to find the index `i` in `middle` such that `html.unescape(middle[:i]) == stripped`.\n\nSince `stripped` is a prefix of `middle_unescaped`, such an `i` should exist, assuming `html.unescape` behaves nicely (concatenation property).\n`unescape(A + B) == unescape(A) + unescape(B)` is mostly true, unless the split splits an entity.\n\nIf we split `foo&lt;` into `foo&l` and `t;`, unescape might not work as expected.\nBut we are looking for a valid split point.\n\nSo we can iterate `i` downwards from `len(middle)`.\nBut that might be slow if `middle` is long.\n\nHowever, we are only stripping punctuation. The amount of punctuation is likely small.\nSo we can iterate from the end of `middle`, accumulating characters into `trail_candidate`, and checking if `unescape(middle_remaining)` matches `stripped`.\n\nWait, `stripped` is `middle_unescaped` without the trailing punctuation.\n\nLet `middle` be the string.\nWe want to find `i` such that `html.unescape(middle[:i]) == stripped`.\n\nWe can start `i` at `len(middle)` and go backwards.\nBut `unescape` can be expensive to call repeatedly.\n\nIs there a better way?\n\nWe know what characters we stripped: `trailing_garbage = middle_unescaped[len(stripped):]`.\n\nIn the example, `trailing_garbage` is `!`.\n\nWe can look at the end of `middle`.\nDoes it match `trailing_garbage`?\n`middle` ends with `!`. `!` matches `!`.\nSo we can strip `!` from `middle`.\nRemaining `middle` is `...&lt`.\n`unescape(...&lt)` is `...<`.\nDoes this match `stripped` (`...<`)? Yes.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n1. Calculate `middle_unescaped`.\n2. Calculate `stripped` and `trailing_garbage`.\n3. If `trailing_garbage` is empty, done.\n4. Iterate backwards from the end of `middle`. Match characters against `trailing_garbage`.\n\nBut wait, `trailing_garbage` is unescaped. `middle` is escaped.\nIf `middle` ends with `&#33;` and `trailing_garbage` is `!`. They don't match as strings.\n\nSo we need to handle entities.\n\nBut `trailing_garbage` only contains characters from `TRAILING_PUNCTUATION_CHARS`.\n`TRAILING_PUNCTUATION_CHARS` = `.,:;!`.\n\nIf `middle` ends with an entity representing one of these, e.g. `&#33;`, we need to handle it.\n\nSo, we can try to find the split point `i` such that `html.unescape(middle[i:]) == trailing_garbage`.\nAnd consequently `html.unescape(middle[:i]) == stripped`.\n\nSince `trailing_garbage` consists only of punctuation, it's likely short.\nWe can iterate `i` from `len(middle)` down to 0.\nAt each step, check if `html.unescape(middle[:i]) == stripped`.\n\nSince we expect the stripped part to be at the end, maybe we can start `i` around `len(middle) - len(trailing_garbage)`?\nNo, because entities make `middle` longer. So `i` will be larger than `len(stripped)`.\n\nSo we can start `i` at `len(middle)` and decrease it.\nBut checking `html.unescape(middle[:i])` is expensive if `middle` is long.\n\nAlternatively, we can check `html.unescape(middle[i:]) == trailing_garbage`.\n`trailing_garbage` is short. `middle[i:]` is short. This is cheap.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n1. `middle_unescaped = html.unescape(middle)`\n2. `stripped = middle_unescaped.rstrip(TRAILING_PUNCTUATION_CHARS)`\n3. `if middle_unescaped == stripped: return ...`\n4. `trailing_garbage = middle_unescaped[len(stripped):]`\n5. Find `i` such that `html.unescape(middle[i:]) == trailing_garbage`.\n   We should search for `i` starting from `len(middle) - len(trailing_garbage)` (optimistic) and going backwards.\n   Actually, since `middle` can be longer than `middle_unescaped`, we should start checking from `len(middle) - len(trailing_garbage)` and go backwards?\n   \n   Wait, `middle[i:]` produces the tail. As `i` decreases, the tail grows.\n   We want the smallest tail (largest `i`) that unescapes to `trailing_garbage`.\n   \n   But wait, there might be ambiguity?\n   `middle` = `abc`\n   `middle_unescaped` = `abc`\n   `stripped` = `ab`\n   `trailing_garbage` = `c`\n   \n   `i=2`: `middle[2:]` = `c`. `unescape('c')` = `c`. Match.\n   \n   What if `middle` = `ab&lt;`\n   `middle_unescaped` = `ab<`\n   `stripped` = `ab<` (assuming `<` is not punctuation)\n   \n   What if `middle` = `ab;`\n   `middle_unescaped` = `ab;`\n   `stripped` = `ab`\n   `trailing_garbage` = `;`\n   \n   `i=2`: `middle[2:]` = `;`. `unescape(';')` = `;`. Match.\n   \n   What if `middle` = `ab&semi;` (if that exists) or `ab&#59;`\n   `middle_unescaped` = `ab;`\n   `stripped` = `ab`\n   `trailing_garbage` = `;`\n   \n   `i=5`: `middle[5:]` = `;`. `unescape` -> `;`. Match.\n   `i=4`: `middle[4:]` = `9;`. `unescape` -> `9;`. No match.\n   ...\n   `i=2`: `middle[2:]` = `&#59;`. `unescape` -> `;`. Match.\n   \n   So we have two matches? `i=5` (tail `;`) and `i=2` (tail `&#59;`).\n   But `middle[:5]` is `ab&#5`. `unescape` -> `ab&#5`. Not `ab`.\n   `middle[:2]` is `ab`. `unescape` -> `ab`. Match.\n   \n   So we need `html.unescape(middle[:i]) == stripped`.\n   \n   But checking `unescape(middle[:i])` is expensive.\n   \n   However, `unescape(middle) == unescape(middle[:i]) + unescape(middle[i:])` is usually true.\n   So if `unescape(middle[i:]) == trailing_garbage`, then `unescape(middle[:i])` should be `stripped`.\n   \n   Is it possible that `unescape(middle[i:]) == trailing_garbage` but `unescape(middle[:i]) != stripped`?\n   Only if the split point `i` is inside an entity.\n   \n   Example: `middle` = `&amp;`\n   `middle_unescaped` = `&`\n   Suppose `stripped` = `` (empty), `trailing_garbage` = `&`.\n   \n   `i=4`: `middle[4:]` = `;`. `unescape` -> `;`. Not `&`.\n   `i=0`: `middle[0:]` = `&amp;`. `unescape` -> `&`. Match.\n   \n   So if we find `i` such that `unescape(middle[i:]) == trailing_garbage`, it is a strong candidate.\n   \n   But in the `ab&#59;` case:\n   `middle` = `ab&#59;`\n   `trailing_garbage` = `;`\n   \n   `i=5`: `middle[5:]` = `;`. `unescape` -> `;`. Match.\n   But `middle[:5]` = `ab&#5`. `unescape` -> `ab&#5`. != `ab`.\n   \n   So we must verify `unescape(middle[:i]) == stripped`.\n   \n   Or, we can just iterate `i` downwards.\n   Since `trailing_garbage` is just punctuation, it shouldn't be very long.\n   So we won't iterate too much.\n   \n   Start `i` at `len(middle)`.\n   Loop:\n     `sub = middle[i:]`\n     `if html.unescape(sub) == trailing_garbage:`\n        `if html.unescape(middle[:i]) == stripped:`\n            `break`\n     `i -= 1`\n     \n   This seems correct and robust.\n   \n   Wait, `trailing_garbage` could be empty? No, we check `if middle_unescaped != stripped`.\n   \n   Is it possible that we don't find such `i`?\n   `middle` produces `middle_unescaped`. `middle_unescaped` splits into `stripped` and `trailing_garbage`.\n   So there must be a split in `middle` that corresponds to this, UNLESS the split point in `middle_unescaped` corresponds to the *middle* of an entity in `middle`.\n   \n   Example: `middle` = `&amp;` -> `&`.\n   Suppose `stripped` = `` and `trailing_garbage` = `&`.\n   Split is before `&`.\n   In `middle`, split is before `&amp;`. `i=0`.\n   `middle[0:]` = `&amp;` -> `&`. Match.\n   \n   What if `middle` = `foo`\n   `middle_unescaped` = `foo`\n   `stripped` = `fo`\n   `trailing_garbage` = `o`\n   \n   `i=2`: `middle[2:]` = `o`. Match.\n   \n   What if `middle` = `&lt;` -> `<`.\n   `stripped` = `<`. `trailing_garbage` = ``.\n   We don't enter the loop.\n   \n   What if `middle` = `&lt` -> `<`.\n   `stripped` = `<`.\n   \n   What if `middle` = `&lt!` -> `<!`.\n   `stripped` = `<`. `trailing_garbage` = `!`.\n   \n   `i=4`: `middle[4:]` = `!`. `unescape` -> `!`. Match.\n   `middle[:4]` = `&lt`. `unescape` -> `<`. Match.\n   \n   So `i=4` is the split point.\n   `middle` becomes `middle[:4]` -> `&lt`.\n   `trail` becomes `middle[4:]` + `trail` -> `!` + `trail`.\n   \n   This looks correct.\n   \n   One optimization:\n   We can iterate `i` from `len(middle) - len(trailing_garbage)` downwards.\n   Because `unescape` usually shrinks or stays same length (except for very rare cases or if we consider `&lt` -> `<` shrinking).\n   Actually `&lt;` (4 chars) -> `<` (1 char). Shrinks.\n   So `len(middle)` >= `len(middle_unescaped)`.\n   So `len(tail_of_middle)` >= `len(trailing_garbage)`.\n   So `len(middle) - i` >= `len(trailing_garbage)`.\n   So `i` <= `len(middle) - len(trailing_garbage)`.\n   \n   So we can start `i` at `len(middle) - len(trailing_garbage)`.\n   \n   Wait, what if `middle` = `a` and `trailing_garbage` = `a`.\n   `i` starts at `1 - 1 = 0`.\n   `middle[0:]` = `a`. Match.\n   \n   What if `middle` = `&#33;` (5 chars) -> `!`.\n   `trailing_garbage` = `!`.\n   `i` starts at `5 - 1 = 4`.\n   `middle[4:]` = `;`. `unescape` -> `;`. != `!`.\n   `i` decreases...\n   `i=0`. `middle[0:]` = `&#33;`. `unescape` -> `!`. Match.\n   \n   So yes, iterating downwards is correct.\n   \n   Is there any case where `unescape` expands?\n   Only if the input is not valid HTML entities but `unescape` does something weird? No, `html.unescape` handles named and numeric entities.\n   Numeric entities: `&#...;`. Always >= 3 chars. Result 1 char (usually).\n   Named entities: `&...;`. Always >= 3 chars. Result 1 char.\n   \n   So `unescape` always shrinks or keeps length.\n   So `len(middle_tail) >= len(unescaped_tail)`.\n   \n   So starting `i` at `len(middle) - len(trailing_garbage)` is safe.\n   \n   Let's verify the file content again to make sure I have the context for `sed`.\n\n```bash\nsed -n '260,290p' django/utils/html.py\n```",

Yes.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n1. Calculate `middle_unescaped`.\n2. Calculate `stripped` and `trailing_garbage`.\n3. If `trailing_garbage` is empty, done.\n4. Iterate backwards from the end of `middle`. Match characters against `trailing_garbage`.\n\nBut wait, `trailing_garbage` is unescaped. `middle` is escaped.\nIf `middle` ends with `&#33;` and `trailing_garbage` is `!`. They don't match as strings.\n\nSo we need to handle entities.\n\nBut `trailing_garbage` only contains characters from `TRAILING_PUNCTUATION_CHARS`.\n`TRAILING_PUNCTUATION_CHARS` = `.,:;!`.\n\nIf `middle` ends with an entity representing one of these, e.g. `&#33;`, we need to handle it.\n\nSo, we can try to find the split point `i` such that `html.unescape(middle[i:]) == trailing_garbage`.\nAnd consequently `html.unescape(middle[:i]) == stripped`.\n\nSince `trailing_garbage` consists only of punctuation, it's likely short.\nWe can iterate `i` from `len(middle)` down to 0.\nAt each step, check if `html.unescape(middle[:i]) == stripped`.\n\nSince we expect the stripped part to be at the end, maybe we can start `i` around `len(middle) - len(trailing_garbage)`?\nNo, because entities make `middle` longer. So `i` will be larger than `len(stripped)`.\n\nSo we can start `i` at `len(middle)` and decrease it.\nBut checking `html.unescape(middle[:i])` is expensive if `middle` is long.\n\nAlternatively, we can check `html.unescape(middle[i:]) == trailing_garbage`.\n`trailing_garbage` is short. `middle[i:]` is short. This is cheap.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n1. `middle_unescaped = html.unescape(middle)`\n2. `stripped = middle_unescaped.rstrip(TRAILING_PUNCTUATION_CHARS)`\n3. `if middle_unescaped == stripped: return ...`\n4. `trailing_garbage = middle_unescaped[len(stripped):]`\n5. Find `i` such that `html.unescape(middle[i:]) == trailing_garbage`.\n   We should search for `i` starting from `len(middle) - len(trailing_garbage)` (optimistic) and going backwards.\n   Actually, since `middle` can be longer than `middle_unescaped`, we should start checking from `len(middle) - len(trailing_garbage)` and go backwards?\n   \n   Wait, `middle[i:]` produces the tail. As `i` decreases, the tail grows.\n   We want the smallest tail (largest `i`) that unescapes to `trailing_garbage`.\n   \n   But wait, there might be ambiguity?\n   `middle` = `abc`\n   `middle_unescaped` = `abc`\n   `stripped` = `ab`\n   `trailing_garbage` = `c`\n   \n   `i=2`: `middle[2:]` = `c`. `unescape('c')` = `c`. Match.\n   \n   What if `middle` = `ab&lt;`\n   `middle_unescaped` = `ab<`\n   `stripped` = `ab<` (assuming `<` is not punctuation)\n   \n   What if `middle` = `ab;`\n   `middle_unescaped` = `ab;`\n   `stripped` = `ab`\n   `trailing_garbage` = `;`\n   \n   `i=2`: `middle[2:]` = `;`. `unescape(';')` = `;`. Match.\n   \n   What if `middle` = `ab&semi;` (if that exists) or `ab&#59;`\n   `middle_unescaped` = `ab;`\n   `stripped` = `ab`\n   `trailing_garbage` = `;`\n   \n   `i=5`: `middle[5:]` = `;`. `unescape` -> `;`. Match.\n   `i=4`: `middle[4:]` = `9;`. `unescape` -> `9;`. No match.\n   ...\n   `i=2`: `middle[2:]` = `&#59;`. `unescape` -> `;`. Match.\n   \n   So we have two matches? `i=5` (tail `;`) and `i=2` (tail `&#59;`).\n   But `middle[:5]` is `ab&#5`. `unescape` -> `ab&#5`. Not `ab`.\n   `middle[:2]` is `ab`. `unescape` -> `ab`. Match.\n   \n   So we need `html.unescape(middle[:i]) == stripped`.\n   \n   But checking `unescape(middle[:i])` is expensive.\n   \n   However, `unescape(middle) == unescape(middle[:i]) + unescape(middle[i:])` is usually true.\n   So if `unescape(middle[i:]) == trailing_garbage`, then `unescape(middle[:i])` should be `stripped`.\n   \n   Is it possible that `unescape(middle[i:]) == trailing_garbage` but `unescape(middle[:i]) != stripped`?\n   Only if the split point `i` is inside an entity.\n   \n   Example: `middle` = `&amp;`\n   `middle_unescaped` = `&`\n   Suppose `stripped` = `` (empty), `trailing_garbage` = `&`.\n   \n   `i=4`: `middle[4:]` = `;`. `unescape` -> `;`. Not `&`.\n   `i=0`: `middle[0:]` = `&amp;`. `unescape` -> `&`. Match.\n   \n   So if we find `i` such that `unescape(middle[i:]) == trailing_garbage`, it is a strong candidate.\n   \n   But in the `ab&#59;` case:\n   `middle` = `ab&#59;`\n   `trailing_garbage` = `;`\n   \n   `i=5`: `middle[5:]` = `;`. `unescape` -> `;`. Match.\n   But `middle[:5]` = `ab&#5`. `unescape` -> `ab&#5`. != `ab`.\n   \n   So we must verify `unescape(middle[:i]) == stripped`.\n   \n   Or, we can just iterate `i` downwards.\n   Since `trailing_garbage` is just punctuation, it shouldn't be very long.\n   So we won't iterate too much.\n   \n   Start `i` at `len(middle)`.\n   Loop:\n     `sub = middle[i:]`\n     `if html.unescape(sub) == trailing_garbage:`\n        `if html.unescape(middle[:i]) == stripped:`\n            `break`\n     `i -= 1`\n     \n   This seems correct and robust.\n   \n   Wait, `trailing_garbage` could be empty? No, we check `if middle_unescaped != stripped`.\n   \n   Is it possible that we don't find such `i`?\n   `middle` produces `middle_unescaped`. `middle_unescaped` splits into `stripped` and `trailing_garbage`.\n   So there must be a split in `middle` that corresponds to this, UNLESS the split point in `middle_unescaped` corresponds to the *middle* of an entity in `middle`.\n   \n   Example: `middle` = `&amp;` -> `&`.\n   Suppose `stripped` = `` and `trailing_garbage` = `&`.\n   Split is before `&`.\n   In `middle`, split is before `&amp;`. `i=0`.\n   `middle[0:]` = `&amp;` -> `&`. Match.\n   \n   What if `middle` = `foo`\n   `middle_unescaped` = `foo`\n   `stripped` = `fo`\n   `trailing_garbage` = `o`\n   \n   `i=2`: `middle[2:]` = `o`. Match.\n   \n   What if `middle` = `&lt;` -> `<`.\n   `stripped` = `<`. `trailing_garbage` = ``.\n   We don't enter the loop.\n   \n   What if `middle` = `&lt` -> `<`.\n   `stripped` = `<`.\n   \n   What if `middle` = `&lt!` -> `<!`.\n   `stripped` = `<`. `trailing_garbage` = `!`.\n   \n   `i=4`: `middle[4:]` = `!`. `unescape` -> `!`. Match.\n   `middle[:4]` = `&lt`. `unescape` -> `<`. Match.\n   \n   So `i=4` is the split point.\n   `middle` becomes `middle[:4]` -> `&lt`.\n   `trail` becomes `middle[4:]` + `trail` -> `!` + `trail`.\n   \n   This looks correct.\n   \n   One optimization:\n   We can iterate `i` from `len(middle) - len(trailing_garbage)` downwards.\n   Because `unescape` usually shrinks or stays same length (except for very rare cases or if we consider `&lt` -> `<` shrinking).\n   Actually `&lt;` (4 chars) -> `<` (1 char). Shrinks.\n   So `len(middle)` >= `len(middle_unescaped)`.\n   So `len(tail_of_middle)` >= `len(trailing_garbage)`.\n   So `len(middle) - i` >= `len(trailing_garbage)`.\n   So `i` <= `len(middle) - len(trailing_garbage)`.\n   \n   So we can start `i` at `len(middle) - len(trailing_garbage)`.\n   \n   Wait, what if `middle` = `a` and `trailing_garbage` = `a`.\n   `i` starts at `1 - 1 = 0`.\n   `middle[0:]` = `a`. Match.\n   \n   What if `middle` = `&#33;` (5 chars) -> `!`.\n   `trailing_garbage` = `!`.\n   `i` starts at `5 - 1 = 4`.\n   `middle[4:]` = `;`. `unescape` -> `;`. != `!`.\n   `i` decreases...\n   `i=0`. `middle[0:]` = `&#33;`. `unescape` -> `!`. Match.\n   \n   So yes, iterating downwards is correct.\n   \n   Is there any case where `unescape` expands?\n   Only if the input is not valid HTML entities but `unescape` does something weird? No, `html.unescape` handles named and numeric entities.\n   Numeric entities: `&#...;`. Always >= 3 chars. Result 1 char (usually).\n   Named entities: `&...;`. Always >= 3 chars. Result 1 char.\n   \n   So `unescape` always shrinks or keeps length.\n   So `len(middle_tail) >= len(unescaped_tail)`.\n   \n   So starting `i` at `len(middle) - len(trailing_garbage)` is safe.\n   \n   Let's verify the file content again to make sure I have the context for `sed`.\n\n```bash\nsed -n '260,290p' django/utils/html.py\n```",
