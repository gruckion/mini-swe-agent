The description of the PR points directly to a bug within `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`. My next step is to examine the specific line of code indicated by the error report.\n\n\n**Debugging the `cotm` Error**\n\nI am now focused on the `NameError`. It appears the variable `cotm` is used in `hyperbolic.py`'s `eval` method without being defined. To diagnose this, I will create a script to reproduce the error and pinpoint the exact location of the undefined variable, to better understand its intended function.\n\n\n",
