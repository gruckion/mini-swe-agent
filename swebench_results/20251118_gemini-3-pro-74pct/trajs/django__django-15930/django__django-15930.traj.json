Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2.

Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\nExample of a CORRECT response:\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n</example_response>\n\nExample of an INCORRECT response:\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n\nNow I'll read the file:\n\n```bash\ncat file.txt\n```\n</example_response>\n\nIf you need to run multiple commands, either:\n1. Combine them in one block using && or ||\n```bash\ncommand1 && command2 || echo \"Error occurred\"\n```\n\n2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.py\nimport numpy as np\nhello = \"world\"\nprint(hello)\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n### Any other command you want to run\n```bash\nanything\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

This is invalid SQL.\n\nThe condition is `~Q(pk__in=[])`.\n`pk__in=[]` means \"pk is in empty list\", which is always False.\n`~Q(pk__in=[])` means \"pk is NOT in empty list\", which is always True.\n\nSo `When(~Q(pk__in=[]), then=Value(True))` should translate to `WHEN 1=1 THEN True` or similar (depending on backend).\n\nThe issue seems to be how `~Q(pk__in=[])` is compiled.\n\nI need to investigate how `Case` and `When` process the condition.\n\nLet's look at `django/db/models/expressions.py` where `Case` and `When` are likely defined.\n\n```bash\nls django/db/models/expressions.py\n```",

      "content": "THOUGHT: In `WhereNode.as_sql`:\n\nIt iterates over children.\n`~Q(pk__in=[])` results in a `WhereNode` with `negated=True` and one child which is the lookup `pk__in=[]`.\n\nThe lookup `pk__in=[]` raises `EmptyResultSet` when compiled because it matches nothing.\n\n```python\n   110\t        for child in self.children:\n   111\t            try:\n   112\t                sql, params = compiler.compile(child)\n   113\t            except EmptyResultSet:\n   114\t                empty_needed -= 1\n```\n\nIf `EmptyResultSet` is raised, `empty_needed` is decremented.\n`empty_needed` starts at `len(self.children)` for `OR` (default connector for Q?) or `1` for `AND`.\n\n`Q(pk__in=[])` is a single condition, so connector is default `AND`.\n`full_needed` = 1, `empty_needed` = 1.\n\nWhen `pk__in=[]` raises `EmptyResultSet`:\n`empty_needed` becomes 0.\n\n```python\n   126\t            if empty_needed == 0:\n   127\t                if self.negated:\n   128\t                    return \"\", []\n   129\t                else:\n   130\t                    raise EmptyResultSet\n```\n\nHere `self.negated` is True (because of `~Q`).\nSo it returns `\"\", []`.\n\nThis explains why we get empty string in `CASE WHEN ... THEN`.\n\nThe issue is that `WhereNode.as_sql` returns empty string when it matches everything (negated empty result set). But `When` expects a valid SQL condition.\n\nIf `WhereNode` returns empty string, it means \"True\" (matches everything) in the context of a WHERE clause (usually). But in `CASE WHEN`, we need an explicit boolean expression like `1=1` or `TRUE`.\n\nWait, if `WhereNode` returns `\"\", []`, it usually means it is ignored in the WHERE clause construction.\ne.g. `SELECT ... WHERE ... AND \"\"` -> `SELECT ... WHERE ...`.\n\nBut `CASE WHEN` syntax requires an expression.\n\nIf `WhereNode` returns empty string, `When.as_sql` puts it into the template: `WHEN %(condition)s THEN ...`.\nSo `WHEN  THEN ...`.\n\nWe need `WhereNode` (or `When`) to handle this case where the condition is \"Always True\".\n\nIf `WhereNode` returns `\"\", []`, it means \"Always True\" if `negated` was involved in the logic that led to it (like here).\n\nIf `WhereNode` returns `\"\", []`, `When` should probably treat it as `True`.\n\nHowever, `WhereNode` logic is designed for WHERE clauses where empty string means \"no constraint\", effectively True.\n\nThe problem is that `When` blindly uses the result of `compiler.compile(self.condition)`.\n\nIf `self.condition` compiles to empty string, `When` should substitute a truthy value.\n\nLet's verify this hypothesis.\n\nIf I modify `django/db/models/expressions.py` in `When.as_sql`:\n\n```python\n   1301\t        condition_sql, condition_params = compiler.compile(self.condition)\n```\n\nIf `condition_sql` is empty, I should check if it means \"True\" or \"False\".\nBut `compiler.compile` doesn't tell us that.\n\nHowever, `WhereNode.as_sql` documentation says:\n> Return '', [] if this node matches everything, None, [] if this node is empty, and raise EmptyResultSet if this node can't match anything.\n\nWait, `None, []` if this node is empty?\nLet's check `WhereNode.as_sql` again.\n\n```python\n   131\t            if full_needed == 0:\n   132\t                if self.negated:\n   133\t                    raise EmptyResultSet\n   134\t                else:\n   135\t                    return \"\", []\n```\n\nIt seems it returns `\"\", []` for \"matches everything\".\n\nIf it matches nothing, it raises `EmptyResultSet`.\n\nSo if `compiler.compile(self.condition)` returns `\"\", []`, it means the condition is always True.\n\nSo in `When.as_sql`, if `condition_sql` is empty, we should probably replace it with `TRUE` (or `1=1`).\n\nBut wait, `WhereNode` is not the only thing that can be a condition.\nIf I have `Q()`, it is empty.\n`Q()` matches everything.\n\n```python\n   1261\t        if isinstance(condition, Q) and not condition:\n   1262\t            raise ValueError(\"An empty Q() can't be used as a When() condition.\")\n```\n\nSo explicit empty `Q` is forbidden. But `~Q(pk__in=[])` is not empty `Q`, it's a negated `Q` with a child.\n\nSo, if `condition_sql` is empty, it implies the condition is satisfied for all rows.\n\nSo I should modify `django/db/models/expressions.py`.\n\nLet's check if there are other cases where `condition_sql` could be empty but NOT mean \"True\".\n\nIf `WhereNode` returns `\"\", []`, it means \"matches everything\".\n\nWhat if `compiler.compile` returns empty string for other reasons?\n\nIf I look at `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, `compile` just delegates.\n\nSo relying on `WhereNode` behavior seems correct.\n\nBut `When` can take other things than `Q` objects (lookups, boolean expressions).\n\nIf I have `When(condition=Value(True), ...)`?\n`Value(True)` compiles to `True` (or `1`).\n\nIf I have `When(condition=Value(False), ...)`?\n`Value(False)` compiles to `False` (or `0`).\n\nSo if `condition_sql` is empty, it's likely coming from a `WhereNode` that optimized itself away.\n\nSo, the fix seems to be in `django/db/models/expressions.py`.\n\n```python\n<<<<\n        condition_sql, condition_params = compiler.compile(self.condition)\n        template_params[\"condition\"] = condition_sql\n====\n        condition_sql, condition_params = compiler.compile(self.condition)\n        if not condition_sql:\n             condition_sql = \"TRUE\" # or connection.ops.no_limit_value() ?\n        template_params[\"condition\"] = condition_sql\n>>>>\n```\n\nWait, `connection.ops` might have something for \"Always True\".\n`connection.features`?\n\nI should check what is the standard way to represent \"Always True\" in SQL across backends in Django.\nUsually `1=1` is safe. Or just `TRUE` if supported.\n\nBut `WhereNode` returning `\"\"` relies on the fact that it's usually joined with `AND` or `OR` or used in `WHERE` clause where empty means nothing.\n\nIn `CASE WHEN`, we MUST have a condition.\n\nIf I use `1=1`, it works everywhere.\n\nLet's verify if `WhereNode` returning `\"\"` ALWAYS means \"matches everything\".\n\nIn `WhereNode.as_sql`:\n```python\n   126\t            if empty_needed == 0:\n   127\t                if self.negated:\n   128\t                    return \"\", []\n```\nHere `empty_needed == 0` means we encountered enough `EmptyResultSet` children.\nFor `AND` (default), `empty_needed` is 1. So if one child raises `EmptyResultSet`, `empty_needed` becomes 0.\nIf `negated` is True, then `NOT (EmptyResultSet)` -> `NOT (False)` -> `True`.\nSo yes, it returns `\"\"` meaning `True`.\n\n```python\n   131\t            if full_needed == 0:\n   132\t                if self.negated:\n   133\t                    raise EmptyResultSet\n   134\t                else:\n   135\t                    return \"\", []\n```\nFor `OR`, `full_needed` is 1. If one child returns SQL (is not empty), `full_needed` becomes 0.\nWait, `full_needed` logic:\n```python\n   116\t                if sql:\n   117\t                    result.append(sql)\n   118\t                    result_params.extend(params)\n   119\t                else:\n   120\t                    full_needed -= 1\n```\nIf `sql` is empty (meaning child matches everything), `full_needed` decrements.\nIf `full_needed` becomes 0, it means we have enough \"matches everything\" children.\nFor `AND`, `full_needed` is `len(children)`. All must match everything.\nFor `OR`, `full_needed` is 1. One matches everything is enough.\n\nSo if `full_needed == 0`, it means the node matches everything.\nIf `negated` is False, it returns `\"\", []`.\nIf `negated` is True, it raises `EmptyResultSet` (NOT True -> False).\n\nSo yes, `\"\", []` consistently means \"matches everything\" (True).\n\nSo in `When.as_sql`, if `condition_sql` is empty, we should treat it as True.\n\nHowever, `When` catches `EmptyResultSet`?\nNo, `When.as_sql` calls `compiler.compile`. `compiler.compile` calls `node.as_sql`.\nIf `node.as_sql` raises `EmptyResultSet`, `compiler.compile` propagates it.\n\nIf `EmptyResultSet` is raised, `When` doesn't catch it.\nIf `When` condition raises `EmptyResultSet`, what happens?\n\nIf I have `When(Q(pk__in=[]), ...)`:\n`Q(pk__in=[])` -> `WhereNode` (not negated).\n`WhereNode.as_sql` -> raises `EmptyResultSet`.\n\nSo `When.as_sql` raises `EmptyResultSet`.\nWho catches it? `Case.as_sql`?\n\nLet's check `Case.as_sql`.\n\n```bash\nnl -ba django/db/models/expressions.py | sed -n '1319,1360p'\n```",

                "content": "THOUGHT: In `WhereNode.as_sql`:\n\nIt iterates over children.\n`~Q(pk__in=[])` results in a `WhereNode` with `negated=True` and one child which is the lookup `pk__in=[]`.\n\nThe lookup `pk__in=[]` raises `EmptyResultSet` when compiled because it matches nothing.\n\n```python\n   110\t        for child in self.children:\n   111\t            try:\n   112\t                sql, params = compiler.compile(child)\n   113\t            except EmptyResultSet:\n   114\t                empty_needed -= 1\n```\n\nIf `EmptyResultSet` is raised, `empty_needed` is decremented.\n`empty_needed` starts at `len(self.children)` for `OR` (default connector for Q?) or `1` for `AND`.\n\n`Q(pk__in=[])` is a single condition, so connector is default `AND`.\n`full_needed` = 1, `empty_needed` = 1.\n\nWhen `pk__in=[]` raises `EmptyResultSet`:\n`empty_needed` becomes 0.\n\n```python\n   126\t            if empty_needed == 0:\n   127\t                if self.negated:\n   128\t                    return \"\", []\n   129\t                else:\n   130\t                    raise EmptyResultSet\n```\n\nHere `self.negated` is True (because of `~Q`).\nSo it returns `\"\", []`.\n\nThis explains why we get empty string in `CASE WHEN ... THEN`.\n\nThe issue is that `WhereNode.as_sql` returns empty string when it matches everything (negated empty result set). But `When` expects a valid SQL condition.\n\nIf `WhereNode` returns empty string, it means \"True\" (matches everything) in the context of a WHERE clause (usually). But in `CASE WHEN`, we need an explicit boolean expression like `1=1` or `TRUE`.\n\nWait, if `WhereNode` returns `\"\", []`, it usually means it is ignored in the WHERE clause construction.\ne.g. `SELECT ... WHERE ... AND \"\"` -> `SELECT ... WHERE ...`.\n\nBut `CASE WHEN` syntax requires an expression.\n\nIf `WhereNode` returns empty string, `When.as_sql` puts it into the template: `WHEN %(condition)s THEN ...`.\nSo `WHEN  THEN ...`.\n\nWe need `WhereNode` (or `When`) to handle this case where the condition is \"Always True\".\n\nIf `WhereNode` returns `\"\", []`, it means \"Always True\" if `negated` was involved in the logic that led to it (like here).\n\nIf `WhereNode` returns `\"\", []`, `When` should probably treat it as `True`.\n\nHowever, `WhereNode` logic is designed for WHERE clauses where empty string means \"no constraint\", effectively True.\n\nThe problem is that `When` blindly uses the result of `compiler.compile(self.condition)`.\n\nIf `self.condition` compiles to empty string, `When` should substitute a truthy value.\n\nLet's verify this hypothesis.\n\nIf I modify `django/db/models/expressions.py` in `When.as_sql`:\n\n```python\n   1301\t        condition_sql, condition_params = compiler.compile(self.condition)\n```\n\nIf `condition_sql` is empty, I should check if it means \"True\" or \"False\".\nBut `compiler.compile` doesn't tell us that.\n\nHowever, `WhereNode.as_sql` documentation says:\n> Return '', [] if this node matches everything, None, [] if this node is empty, and raise EmptyResultSet if this node can't match anything.\n\nWait, `None, []` if this node is empty?\nLet's check `WhereNode.as_sql` again.\n\n```python\n   131\t            if full_needed == 0:\n   132\t                if self.negated:\n   133\t                    raise EmptyResultSet\n   134\t                else:\n   135\t                    return \"\", []\n```\n\nIt seems it returns `\"\", []` for \"matches everything\".\n\nIf it matches nothing, it raises `EmptyResultSet`.\n\nSo if `compiler.compile(self.condition)` returns `\"\", []`, it means the condition is always True.\n\nSo in `When.as_sql`, if `condition_sql` is empty, we should probably replace it with `TRUE` (or `1=1`).\n\nBut wait, `WhereNode` is not the only thing that can be a condition.\nIf I have `Q()`, it is empty.\n`Q()` matches everything.\n\n```python\n   1261\t        if isinstance(condition, Q) and not condition:\n   1262\t            raise ValueError(\"An empty Q() can't be used as a When() condition.\")\n```\n\nSo explicit empty `Q` is forbidden. But `~Q(pk__in=[])` is not empty `Q`, it's a negated `Q` with a child.\n\nSo, if `condition_sql` is empty, it implies the condition is satisfied for all rows.\n\nSo I should modify `django/db/models/expressions.py`.\n\nLet's check if there are other cases where `condition_sql` could be empty but NOT mean \"True\".\n\nIf `WhereNode` returns `\"\", []`, it means \"matches everything\".\n\nWhat if `compiler.compile` returns empty string for other reasons?\n\nIf I look at `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, `compile` just delegates.\n\nSo relying on `WhereNode` behavior seems correct.\n\nBut `When` can take other things than `Q` objects (lookups, boolean expressions).\n\nIf I have `When(condition=Value(True), ...)`?\n`Value(True)` compiles to `True` (or `1`).\n\nIf I have `When(condition=Value(False), ...)`?\n`Value(False)` compiles to `False` (or `0`).\n\nSo if `condition_sql` is empty, it's likely coming from a `WhereNode` that optimized itself away.\n\nSo, the fix seems to be in `django/db/models/expressions.py`.\n\n```python\n<<<<\n        condition_sql, condition_params = compiler.compile(self.condition)\n        template_params[\"condition\"] = condition_sql\n====\n        condition_sql, condition_params = compiler.compile(self.condition)\n        if not condition_sql:\n             condition_sql = \"TRUE\" # or connection.ops.no_limit_value() ?\n        template_params[\"condition\"] = condition_sql\n>>>>\n```\n\nWait, `connection.ops` might have something for \"Always True\".\n`connection.features`?\n\nI should check what is the standard way to represent \"Always True\" in SQL across backends in Django.\nUsually `1=1` is safe. Or just `TRUE` if supported.\n\nBut `WhereNode` returning `\"\"` relies on the fact that it's usually joined with `AND` or `OR` or used in `WHERE` clause where empty means nothing.\n\nIn `CASE WHEN`, we MUST have a condition.\n\nIf I use `1=1`, it works everywhere.\n\nLet's verify if `WhereNode` returning `\"\"` ALWAYS means \"matches everything\".\n\nIn `WhereNode.as_sql`:\n```python\n   126\t            if empty_needed == 0:\n   127\t                if self.negated:\n   128\t                    return \"\", []\n```\nHere `empty_needed == 0` means we encountered enough `EmptyResultSet` children.\nFor `AND` (default), `empty_needed` is 1. So if one child raises `EmptyResultSet`, `empty_needed` becomes 0.\nIf `negated` is True, then `NOT (EmptyResultSet)` -> `NOT (False)` -> `True`.\nSo yes, it returns `\"\"` meaning `True`.\n\n```python\n   131\t            if full_needed == 0:\n   132\t                if self.negated:\n   133\t                    raise EmptyResultSet\n   134\t                else:\n   135\t                    return \"\", []\n```\nFor `OR`, `full_needed` is 1.

THEN`.\n`CASE WHEN 1=1 THEN ...` is valid.\n\nIf I used `TRUE`, Oracle might complain if it expects a boolean expression but Oracle SQL doesn't have boolean type in SQL (it uses 1=1 or similar).\nWait, Oracle 12c+ has boolean literals in PL/SQL but in SQL?\nIn Oracle SQL, `CASE WHEN 1=1 THEN ...` works. `CASE WHEN TRUE THEN ...` might not work in older versions or depending on context.\nDjango usually handles `True` as `1` or `1=1` depending on context.\n\nIf I look at `django/db/backends/oracle/base.py` or `ops.py`, I might find how they handle booleans.\n\nBut `1=1` is universally accepted as a true condition in SQL.\n\nSo I'm good.\n\nI'll submit the changes.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
