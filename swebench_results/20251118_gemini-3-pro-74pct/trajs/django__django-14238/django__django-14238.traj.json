Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2.

Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\nExample of a CORRECT response:\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first.

No, I ran it once.\nMaybe `reproduce_issue.py` is importing itself?\n\nIn `reproduce_issue.py`:\n```python\n        DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD=\"reproduce_issue.MyBigAutoField\",\n```\n\nWhen Django sets up, it imports `reproduce_issue` to get `MyBigAutoField`.\nSo `reproduce_issue.py` is executed again as a module.\n\nWhen it is executed as a module `reproduce_issue`, `__name__` is `reproduce_issue`.\nWhen I run it as `python3 reproduce_issue.py`, `__name__` is `__main__`.\n\nSo the script runs twice.\n1. As `__main__`. It calls `settings.configure`. Then `django.setup()`.\n2. `django.setup()` -> ... -> imports `reproduce_issue` (because of `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`).\n3. Inside the import of `reproduce_issue`, it executes the code again.\n   It defines `MyBigAutoField`.\n   It skips `settings.configure` because `settings.configured` is true (configured in `__main__`).\n   It calls `django.setup()`. `django.setup()` is idempotent-ish but might complain if called recursively or if apps are loading.\n   Then it defines `MyModel`.\n\nThe `MyModel` definition in the imported module `reproduce_issue` registers the model.\nThen the `MyModel` definition in `__main__` tries to register the model again.\n\nSince I set `app_label = 'reproduce_issue'`, both try to register as `reproduce_issue.MyModel`.\nOne class is `<class 'reproduce_issue.MyModel'>` (from the import).\nThe other is `<class '__main__.MyModel'>` (from the main execution).\n\nThis causes the conflict.\n\nHowever, the fact that it got to the conflict means it passed the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` check!\nThe `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` check happens during `django.setup()` (specifically `apps.populate` -> `import_models` -> `_prepare` -> `_get_default_pk_class`).\n\nIf the check failed, it would have raised `ValueError` during `django.setup()` inside `__main__` (or inside the recursive import if that's where it triggers).\n\nActually, `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is used when a model is prepared.\nIn `__main__`, `django.setup()` is called.\nThen `class MyModel` is defined.\n`MyModel` inherits `models.Model`.\n`ModelBase.__new__` calls `_prepare`.\n`_prepare` calls `_get_default_pk_class`.\n`_get_default_pk_class` imports `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.\nIt imports `reproduce_issue`.\nThis executes `reproduce_issue.py`.\nInside `reproduce_issue.py`, `django.setup()` is called again.\nThen `class MyModel` is defined (inside `reproduce_issue` module).\nThis inner `MyModel` also triggers `_prepare`.\nIt calls `_get_default_pk_class`.\nIt sees `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is `reproduce_issue.MyBigAutoField`.\nIt checks if `MyBigAutoField` is subclass of `AutoField`.\nIf this check passes, `MyModel` (inner) is created.\nThen `reproduce_issue` module finishes importing.\nThen `_get_default_pk_class` (outer) gets `MyBigAutoField`.\nIt checks if `MyBigAutoField` is subclass of `AutoField`.\nIf this check passes, `MyModel` (outer) continues creation.\nThen it tries to register `MyModel` (outer).\nAnd crashes because `MyModel` (inner) is already registered.\n\nSo the `ValueError` is gone, which means the fix is working!\n\nTo make the reproduction script clean, I should avoid the recursive execution logic or handle it.\nI can wrap the execution logic in `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`.\n\nBut `MyBigAutoField` needs to be importable.\n\nI'll modify `reproduce_issue.py` to be cleaner.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > reproduce_issue.py\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\n\n# Define the custom BigAutoField subclass\nclass MyBigAutoField(models.BigAutoField):\n    pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Configure Django settings\n    if not settings.configured:\n        settings.configure(\n            INSTALLED_APPS=[\"reproduce_issue_app\"],\n            DATABASES={\"default\": {\"ENGINE\": \"django.db.backends.sqlite3\", \"NAME\": \":memory:\"}},\n            DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD=\"reproduce_issue.MyBigAutoField\",\n        )\n\n    import django\n    # Mock an app config so we can use an app label\n    from django.apps import AppConfig\n    \n    class ReproduceIssueAppConfig(AppConfig):\n        name = 'reproduce_issue_app'\n        label = 'reproduce_issue_app'\n        \n    # We need to register this app config somehow or just use a dummy app name that doesn't require a config if we don't use it for discovery.\n    # But INSTALLED_APPS needs to point to something.\n    # Let's just use a fake app module structure or just rely on the fact that we are defining the model manually.\n    \n    # Actually, simpler approach:\n    # Create a separate file for the field definition so it can be imported without side effects.\n    pass\nEOF\n```\n\nBetter yet, I'll split it into two files. `my_field.py` and `reproduce_issue.py`.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > my_field.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyBigAutoField(models.BigAutoField):\n    pass\nEOF\n```\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > reproduce_issue.py\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\n\n# Configure Django settings\nif not settings.configured:\n    settings.configure(\n        INSTALLED_APPS=[],\n        DATABASES={\"default\": {\"ENGINE\": \"django.db.backends.sqlite3\", \"NAME\": \":memory:\"}},\n        DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD=\"my_field.MyBigAutoField\",\n    )\n\nimport django\ndjango.setup()\n\n# Define a model using the custom auto field\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'reproduce_issue'\n\nprint(\"Model created successfully\")\nEOF\n```\n\nNow run `reproduce_issue.py`.\n\n```bash\npython3 reproduce_issue.py\n```",

Inside the import of `reproduce_issue`, it executes the code again.\n   It defines `MyBigAutoField`.\n   It skips `settings.configure` because `settings.configured` is true (configured in `__main__`).\n   It calls `django.setup()`. `django.setup()` is idempotent-ish but might complain if called recursively or if apps are loading.\n   Then it defines `MyModel`.\n\nThe `MyModel` definition in the imported module `reproduce_issue` registers the model.\nThen the `MyModel` definition in `__main__` tries to register the model again.\n\nSince I set `app_label = 'reproduce_issue'`, both try to register as `reproduce_issue.MyModel`.\nOne class is `<class 'reproduce_issue.MyModel'>` (from the import).\nThe other is `<class '__main__.MyModel'>` (from the main execution).\n\nThis causes the conflict.\n\nHowever, the fact that it got to the conflict means it passed the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` check!\nThe `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` check happens during `django.setup()` (specifically `apps.populate` -> `import_models` -> `_prepare` -> `_get_default_pk_class`).\n\nIf the check failed, it would have raised `ValueError` during `django.setup()` inside `__main__` (or inside the recursive import if that's where it triggers).\n\nActually, `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is used when a model is prepared.\nIn `__main__`, `django.setup()` is called.\nThen `class MyModel` is defined.\n`MyModel` inherits `models.Model`.\n`ModelBase.__new__` calls `_prepare`.\n`_prepare` calls `_get_default_pk_class`.\n`_get_default_pk_class` imports `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.\nIt imports `reproduce_issue`.\nThis executes `reproduce_issue.py`.\nInside `reproduce_issue.py`, `django.setup()` is called again.\nThen `class MyModel` is defined (inside `reproduce_issue` module).\nThis inner `MyModel` also triggers `_prepare`.\nIt calls `_get_default_pk_class`.\nIt sees `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is `reproduce_issue.MyBigAutoField`.\nIt checks if `MyBigAutoField` is subclass of `AutoField`.\nIf this check passes, `MyModel` (inner) is created.\nThen `reproduce_issue` module finishes importing.\nThen `_get_default_pk_class` (outer) gets `MyBigAutoField`.\nIt checks if `MyBigAutoField` is subclass of `AutoField`.\nIf this check passes, `MyModel` (outer) continues creation.\nThen it tries to register `MyModel` (outer).\nAnd crashes because `MyModel` (inner) is already registered.\n\nSo the `ValueError` is gone, which means the fix is working!\n\nTo make the reproduction script clean, I should avoid the recursive execution logic or handle it.\nI can wrap the execution logic in `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`.\n\nBut `MyBigAutoField` needs to be importable.\n\nI'll modify `reproduce_issue.py` to be cleaner.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > reproduce_issue.py\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\n\n# Define the custom BigAutoField subclass\nclass MyBigAutoField(models.BigAutoField):\n    pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Configure Django settings\n    if not settings.configured:\n        settings.configure(\n            INSTALLED_APPS=[\"reproduce_issue_app\"],\n            DATABASES={\"default\": {\"ENGINE\": \"django.db.backends.sqlite3\", \"NAME\": \":memory:\"}},\n            DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD=\"reproduce_issue.MyBigAutoField\",\n        )\n\n    import django\n    # Mock an app config so we can use an app label\n    from django.apps import AppConfig\n    \n    class ReproduceIssueAppConfig(AppConfig):\n        name = 'reproduce_issue_app'\n        label = 'reproduce_issue_app'\n        \n    # We need to register this app config somehow or just use a dummy app name that doesn't require a config if we don't use it for discovery.\n    # But INSTALLED_APPS needs to point to something.\n    # Let's just use a fake app module structure or just rely on the fact that we are defining the model manually.\n    \n    # Actually, simpler approach:\n    # Create a separate file for the field definition so it can be imported without side effects.\n    pass\nEOF\n```\n\nBetter yet, I'll split it into two files. `my_field.py` and `reproduce_issue.py`.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > my_field.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MyBigAutoField(models.BigAutoField):\n    pass\nEOF\n```\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > reproduce_issue.py\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\n\n# Configure Django settings\nif not settings.configured:\n    settings.configure(\n        INSTALLED_APPS=[],\n        DATABASES={\"default\": {\"ENGINE\": \"django.db.backends.sqlite3\", \"NAME\": \":memory:\"}},\n        DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD=\"my_field.MyBigAutoField\",\n    )\n\nimport django\ndjango.setup()\n\n# Define a model using the custom auto field\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'reproduce_issue'\n\nprint(\"Model created successfully\")\nEOF\n```\n\nNow run `reproduce_issue.py`.\n\n```bash\npython3 reproduce_issue.py\n```",
