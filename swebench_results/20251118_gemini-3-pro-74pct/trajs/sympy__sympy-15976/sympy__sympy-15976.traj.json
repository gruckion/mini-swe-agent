Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1.

      "content": "THOUGHT: The code splits the symbol name into name, supers, and subs using `split_super_sub`.\nThen it constructs the MathML.\n\nIf `sym.name` is `x2`, `split_super_sub` probably splits it into `x` and `2` (as a subscript).\n\nIf `subs` is not empty (which it is for `x2` -> `subs=['2']`), it goes to line 786:\n```python\n   786\t                msub = self.dom.createElement('msub')\n   787\t                msub.appendChild(mname)\n   788\t                msub.appendChild(join(subs))\n   789\t                x.appendChild(msub)\n```\n`x` is created at line 746 as `<mi>`.\n`mname` is created at line 780 as `<mi>name</mi>`.\n`join(subs)` creates `<mi>2</mi>` (since `subs` has 1 item).\n\nSo we get:\n`x` (which is `<mi>`)\n  appends `msub`\n    appends `mname` (`<mi>x</mi>`)\n    appends `join(subs)` (`<mi>2</mi>`)\n\nResult:\n`<mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>2</mi></msub></mi>`\n\nThis is indeed what I saw in the output.\nThe problem is that `<mi>` should not contain `<msub>`. `<msub>` is a layout element.\nIf we have a subscript, the top-level element should be `<msub>`, not `<mi>`.\n\nIf there are no supers/subs (lines 782-784), it does:\n```python\n   784\t                x.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(name))\n```\nResult: `<mi>name</mi>`. This is correct.\n\nBut if there are supers/subs, it appends `msub` or `msup` or `msubsup` to `x` (which is `<mi>`).\nThis wraps the layout element inside `<mi>`, which is invalid MathML (or at least causes rendering issues as described).\n\nThe fix should be to NOT create `x = self.dom.createElement('mi')` at the beginning if we are going to return a `msub`/`msup`/`msubsup`.\nOr rather, `x` should be the result of the layout construction.\n\nHowever, `_print_Symbol` is expected to return a DOM element.\n\nIf I look at lines 746:\n```python\n   746\t        x = self.dom.createElement('mi')\n```\n\nAnd then lines 789, 795:\n```python\n   789\t                x.appendChild(msub)\n   795\t                x.appendChild(msup)\n```\n\nIt seems the intention was to return `x`. But `x` is initialized as `mi`.\n\nIf I change `x` to be just the `msub` element, that would be correct structure-wise.\nBut wait, `_print_Symbol` takes `style` argument.\n```python\n   748\t        if style == 'bold':\n   749\t            x.setAttribute('mathvariant', 'bold')\n```\nIf I return `msub`, where do I put the bold attribute?\nUsually, the bold attribute should be on the identifier `<mi>`, not on `<msub>`.\n\nIn the current code:\n`x` is `<mi>`. If bold, `<mi mathvariant=\"bold\">`.\nThen it appends `<msub>`.\nSo `<mi mathvariant=\"bold\"><msub>...</msub></mi>`.\nThis applies bold to the content of `mi`. But `mi` content is `msub`.\n\nIf I change it so that `msub` is the top level, then `mname` (which is `<mi>name</mi>`) should receive the bold attribute.\n\nLet's see where `mname` is created.\n```python\n   780\t        mname = self.dom.createElement('mi')\n   781\t        mname.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(name))\n```\nI should probably apply the style to `mname`.\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. Don't create `x` as `mi` initially. Or at least, don't use it as the root if we have subs/supers.\n2. Apply style to `mname`.\n3. Return `msub`, `msup`, or `msubsup` directly if they exist.\n4. If no subs/supers, return `mname` (with style applied).\n\nLet's check `split_super_sub` to be sure what it does. It's likely imported.\nI'll check imports in `sympy/printing/mathml.py`.\n\n```bash\nhead -n 20 sympy/printing/mathml.py\n```",

                "content": "THOUGHT: The code splits the symbol name into name, supers, and subs using `split_super_sub`.\nThen it constructs the MathML.\n\nIf `sym.name` is `x2`, `split_super_sub` probably splits it into `x` and `2` (as a subscript).\n\nIf `subs` is not empty (which it is for `x2` -> `subs=['2']`), it goes to line 786:\n```python\n   786\t                msub = self.dom.createElement('msub')\n   787\t                msub.appendChild(mname)\n   788\t                msub.appendChild(join(subs))\n   789\t                x.appendChild(msub)\n```\n`x` is created at line 746 as `<mi>`.\n`mname` is created at line 780 as `<mi>name</mi>`.\n`join(subs)` creates `<mi>2</mi>` (since `subs` has 1 item).\n\nSo we get:\n`x` (which is `<mi>`)\n  appends `msub`\n    appends `mname` (`<mi>x</mi>`)\n    appends `join(subs)` (`<mi>2</mi>`)\n\nResult:\n`<mi><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>2</mi></msub></mi>`\n\nThis is indeed what I saw in the output.\nThe problem is that `<mi>` should not contain `<msub>`. `<msub>` is a layout element.\nIf we have a subscript, the top-level element should be `<msub>`, not `<mi>`.\n\nIf there are no supers/subs (lines 782-784), it does:\n```python\n   784\t                x.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(name))\n```\nResult: `<mi>name</mi>`. This is correct.\n\nBut if there are supers/subs, it appends `msub` or `msup` or `msubsup` to `x` (which is `<mi>`).\nThis wraps the layout element inside `<mi>`, which is invalid MathML (or at least causes rendering issues as described).\n\nThe fix should be to NOT create `x = self.dom.createElement('mi')` at the beginning if we are going to return a `msub`/`msup`/`msubsup`.\nOr rather, `x` should be the result of the layout construction.\n\nHowever, `_print_Symbol` is expected to return a DOM element.\n\nIf I look at lines 746:\n```python\n   746\t        x = self.dom.createElement('mi')\n```\n\nAnd then lines 789, 795:\n```python\n   789\t                x.appendChild(msub)\n   795\t                x.appendChild(msup)\n```\n\nIt seems the intention was to return `x`. But `x` is initialized as `mi`.\n\nIf I change `x` to be just the `msub` element, that would be correct structure-wise.\nBut wait, `_print_Symbol` takes `style` argument.\n```python\n   748\t        if style == 'bold':\n   749\t            x.setAttribute('mathvariant', 'bold')\n```\nIf I return `msub`, where do I put the bold attribute?\nUsually, the bold attribute should be on the identifier `<mi>`, not on `<msub>`.\n\nIn the current code:\n`x` is `<mi>`. If bold, `<mi mathvariant=\"bold\">`.\nThen it appends `<msub>`.\nSo `<mi mathvariant=\"bold\"><msub>...</msub></mi>`.\nThis applies bold to the content of `mi`. But `mi` content is `msub`.\n\nIf I change it so that `msub` is the top level, then `mname` (which is `<mi>name</mi>`) should receive the bold attribute.\n\nLet's see where `mname` is created.\n```python\n   780\t        mname = self.dom.createElement('mi')\n   781\t        mname.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(name))\n```\nI should probably apply the style to `mname`.\n\nSo the plan is:\n1. Don't create `x` as `mi` initially. Or at least, don't use it as the root if we have subs/supers.\n2. Apply style to `mname`.\n3. Return `msub`, `msup`, or `msubsup` directly if they exist.\n4. If no subs/supers, return `mname` (with style applied).\n\nLet's check `split_super_sub` to be sure what it does. It's likely imported.\nI'll check imports in `sympy/printing/mathml.py`.\n\n```bash\nhead -n 20 sympy/printing/mathml.py\n```",

Yes it does.\n\nOne detail: In the original code, if no supers/subs:\n```python\n   784\t                x.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(name))\n```\n`x` was created as `mi`. So it returns `<mi>name</mi>`.\nMy proposed `mname` is also `<mi>name</mi>`. So that matches.\n\nIn the original code, if supers/subs exist:\n`x` (mi) -> `msub` -> `mname` (mi)\nMy proposed:\n`msub` -> `mname` (mi)\n\nThis removes the outer `mi`. This seems correct according to MathML spec. `msub` should contain the base expression (which is `mi` here) and the subscript.\n\nLet's verify what `join` returns.\n`join` returns `mrow` or `mi`.\nSo `msub` will contain `mi` (base) and `mrow`/`mi` (subscript). This is correct.\n\nSo I will apply this change.\n\nI'll read the file content again to make sure I have the context for `sed` or just rewrite the method. Since the method is relatively long (lines 745-802), I might want to rewrite the whole method.\n\nLet's check the indentation. It seems to be 4 spaces.\n\nI will use a python script to rewrite the file because it's safer than `sed` for multi-line replacements with logic changes.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > modify_mathml.py\nimport sys\n\nwith open('sympy/printing/mathml.py', 'r') as f:\n    lines = f.readlines()\n\nstart_line = 744 # 0-indexed, so line 745\n# Find the end of _print_Symbol\nend_line = start_line\nwhile end_line < len(lines):\n    if lines[end_line].strip().startswith('def _print_MatrixSymbol'):\n        break\n    end_line += 1\n\n# The lines to replace\nold_code = lines[start_line:end_line]\n\n# Construct new code\nnew_code = []\nnew_code.append(\"    def _print_Symbol(self, sym, style='plain'):\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        def join(items):\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            if len(items) > 1:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                mrow = self.dom.createElement('mrow')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                for i, item in enumerate(items):\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                    if i > 0:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                        mo = self.dom.createElement('mo')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                        mo.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(\\\" \\\"))\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                        mrow.appendChild(mo)\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                    mi = self.dom.createElement('mi')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                    mi.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(item))\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                    mrow.appendChild(mi)\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                return mrow\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            else:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                mi = self.dom.createElement('mi')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                mi.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(items[0]))\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                return mi\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        # translate name, supers and subs to unicode characters\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        def translate(s):\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            if s in greek_unicode:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                return greek_unicode.get(s)\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            else:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                return s\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        name, supers, subs = split_super_sub(sym.name)\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        name = translate(name)\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        supers = [translate(sup) for sup in supers]\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        subs = [translate(sub) for sub in subs]\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        mname = self.dom.createElement('mi')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        mname.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(name))\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        if style == 'bold':\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            mname.setAttribute('mathvariant', 'bold')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        if len(supers) == 0:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            if len(subs) == 0:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                return mname\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            else:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msub = self.dom.createElement('msub')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msub.appendChild(mname)\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msub.appendChild(join(subs))\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                return msub\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        else:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            if len(subs) == 0:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msup = self.dom.createElement('msup')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msup.appendChild(mname)\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msup.appendChild(join(supers))\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                return msup\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            else:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msubsup = self.dom.createElement('msubsup')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msubsup.appendChild(mname)\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msubsup.appendChild(join(subs))\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msubsup.appendChild(join(supers))\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                return msubsup\\n\") # Wait, variable name in original was msubsup?

If supers/subs, return `msub`/`msup`/`msubsup` containing `mname`.\n\nWait, `mname` is created as:\n```python\n        mname = self.dom.createElement('mi')\n        mname.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(name))\n```\n\nIf I change the logic, I need to make sure `mname` gets the style.\n\nProposed logic:\n\n```python\n    def _print_Symbol(self, sym, style='plain'):\n        # Remove initial x creation\n        \n        def join(items):\n             # ... same ...\n\n        def translate(s):\n             # ... same ...\n\n        name, supers, subs = split_super_sub(sym.name)\n        name = translate(name)\n        supers = [translate(sup) for sup in supers]\n        subs = [translate(sub) for sub in subs]\n\n        mname = self.dom.createElement('mi')\n        mname.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(name))\n        \n        if style == 'bold':\n            mname.setAttribute('mathvariant', 'bold')\n\n        if len(supers) == 0:\n            if len(subs) == 0:\n                return mname\n            else:\n                msub = self.dom.createElement('msub')\n                msub.appendChild(mname)\n                msub.appendChild(join(subs))\n                return msub\n        else:\n            if len(subs) == 0:\n                msup = self.dom.createElement('msup')\n                msup.appendChild(mname)\n                msup.appendChild(join(supers))\n                return msup\n            else:\n                msubsup = self.dom.createElement('msubsup')\n                msubsup.appendChild(mname)\n                msubsup.appendChild(join(subs))\n                msubsup.appendChild(join(supers))\n                return mmsubsup\n```\n\nWait, I need to check if `join` uses `self.dom`. Yes it does.\n\nOne detail: In the original code, if no supers/subs:\n```python\n   784\t                x.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(name))\n```\n`x` was created as `mi`. So it returns `<mi>name</mi>`.\nMy proposed `mname` is also `<mi>name</mi>`. So that matches.\n\nIn the original code, if supers/subs exist:\n`x` (mi) -> `msub` -> `mname` (mi)\nMy proposed:\n`msub` -> `mname` (mi)\n\nThis removes the outer `mi`. This seems correct according to MathML spec. `msub` should contain the base expression (which is `mi` here) and the subscript.\n\nLet's verify what `join` returns.\n`join` returns `mrow` or `mi`.\nSo `msub` will contain `mi` (base) and `mrow`/`mi` (subscript). This is correct.\n\nSo I will apply this change.\n\nI'll read the file content again to make sure I have the context for `sed` or just rewrite the method. Since the method is relatively long (lines 745-802), I might want to rewrite the whole method.\n\nLet's check the indentation. It seems to be 4 spaces.\n\nI will use a python script to rewrite the file because it's safer than `sed` for multi-line replacements with logic changes.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > modify_mathml.py\nimport sys\n\nwith open('sympy/printing/mathml.py', 'r') as f:\n    lines = f.readlines()\n\nstart_line = 744 # 0-indexed, so line 745\n# Find the end of _print_Symbol\nend_line = start_line\nwhile end_line < len(lines):\n    if lines[end_line].strip().startswith('def _print_MatrixSymbol'):\n        break\n    end_line += 1\n\n# The lines to replace\nold_code = lines[start_line:end_line]\n\n# Construct new code\nnew_code = []\nnew_code.append(\"    def _print_Symbol(self, sym, style='plain'):\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        def join(items):\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            if len(items) > 1:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                mrow = self.dom.createElement('mrow')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                for i, item in enumerate(items):\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                    if i > 0:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                        mo = self.dom.createElement('mo')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                        mo.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(\\\" \\\"))\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                        mrow.appendChild(mo)\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                    mi = self.dom.createElement('mi')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                    mi.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(item))\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                    mrow.appendChild(mi)\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                return mrow\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            else:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                mi = self.dom.createElement('mi')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                mi.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(items[0]))\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                return mi\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        # translate name, supers and subs to unicode characters\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        def translate(s):\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            if s in greek_unicode:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                return greek_unicode.get(s)\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            else:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                return s\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        name, supers, subs = split_super_sub(sym.name)\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        name = translate(name)\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        supers = [translate(sup) for sup in supers]\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        subs = [translate(sub) for sub in subs]\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        mname = self.dom.createElement('mi')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        mname.appendChild(self.dom.createTextNode(name))\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        if style == 'bold':\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            mname.setAttribute('mathvariant', 'bold')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        if len(supers) == 0:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            if len(subs) == 0:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                return mname\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            else:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msub = self.dom.createElement('msub')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msub.appendChild(mname)\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msub.appendChild(join(subs))\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                return msub\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"        else:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            if len(subs) == 0:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msup = self.dom.createElement('msup')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msup.appendChild(mname)\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msup.appendChild(join(supers))\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                return msup\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"            else:\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msubsup = self.dom.createElement('msubsup')\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msubsup.appendChild(mname)\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msubsup.appendChild(join(subs))\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                msubsup.appendChild(join(supers))\\n\")\nnew_code.append(\"                return msubsup\\n\") # Wait, variable name in original was msubsup?
