This means any version >9 is not allowed for any check of something >1. That is, treated as string '0.6' > '0.10', but treated as versions '0.6' < '0.10'. Since Sphinx does the former, some extension versions may not be allowed when they should be.\r\n\r\n### How to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors\r\n$ cd mplcursors\r\n$ pip install -r .doc-requirements.txt\r\n$ pip install -e .\r\n$ make -C doc html\r\n```\r\nThis passes just fine, because the requirements pin sphinx-gallery to 0.9. But if you then update to the current 0.10 release:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip install sphinx-gallery==0.10\r\n$ make -C doc html\r\n```\r\nresults in a failure due to a \"not new enough\" version:\r\n```\r\nRunning Sphinx v4.1.2\r\nloading translations [en]... done\r\nmaking output directory... done\r\n\r\nSphinx version error:\r\nThis project needs the extension sphinx_gallery.gen_gallery at least in version 0.6.0 and therefore cannot be built with the loaded version (0.10.0).\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nsphinx-gallery 0.10.0 should be accepted if 0.6 is the minimum specified.\r\n\r\n### Your project\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### OS\r\n\r\nFedora\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\n3.9.6\r\n\r\n### Sphinx version\r\n\r\n4.1.2\r\n\r\n### Sphinx extensions\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Extra tools\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.

                "content": "THOUGHT: It raises `InvalidVersion`. This means if a user puts garbage in `needs_extensions`, Sphinx will crash with a traceback instead of a nice error message.\n\nThe original code did string comparison, so \"invalid\" > \"0.1\" would be True (since 'i' > '0').\n\nIf I want to be robust, I should catch `InvalidVersion`. However, `needs_extensions` expects versions. If the user provides something that isn't a version, maybe crashing (or raising an error) is appropriate, but a cleaner error would be better.\n\nBut strictly speaking, the task is to fix the string comparison issue.\n\nIf `extension.version` is invalid (e.g. the extension author put something weird), `parse(extension.version)` will also raise `InvalidVersion`.\n\nLet's see if I should wrap this in a try-except block.\n\n```python\n        try:\n            if extension.version == 'unknown version' or parse(reqversion) > parse(extension.version):\n                raise VersionRequirementError(...)\n        except InvalidVersion:\n             # Fallback to string comparison? Or warn?\n             # If we fallback to string comparison, we reintroduce the bug for some cases, but maybe better than crashing?\n             # Or just let it crash or report that version is invalid.\n             pass\n```\n\nIf `reqversion` is invalid, it's a user configuration error.\nIf `extension.version` is invalid, it's an extension author error.\n\nGiven the instructions \"fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase\", and the codebase generally seems to assume valid inputs or handle errors gracefully.\n\nIf I look at `sphinx/extension.py`, it imports `VersionRequirementError`.\n\nIf I don't handle `InvalidVersion`, the user gets a traceback.\n\nLet's see if I can import `InvalidVersion` from `packaging.version`.\n\n```bash\npython3 -c \"from packaging.version import InvalidVersion; print('ok')\"\n```",
