      "content": "THOUGHT: Wait, the error says: `Reverse for 'reproduce_app_mainmodel_change' not found.`\n\nWhy `mainmodel`? I thought we were looking for `relatedmodel`.\n\nIn `reproduce_issue.py`:\n```python\n    # get_admin_url(self, remote_field, remote_obj)\n    remote_field = MainModel._meta.get_field('related')\n    remote_obj = related_obj\n```\n\n`remote_field` is the ForeignKey field on `MainModel` pointing to `RelatedModel`.\n`remote_field.model` should be `MainModel` (the model the field is defined on) or `RelatedModel` (the model the field points to)?\n\nLet's check `django/db/models/fields/related.py` or just check in script.\n\nIf `remote_field` is `MainModel.related`, then `remote_field.model` is `MainModel`.\nBut `remote_field.related_model` is `RelatedModel`.\n\nLet's check `get_admin_url` implementation again.\n\n```python\n   206\t    def get_admin_url(self, remote_field, remote_obj):\n   207\t        url_name = 'admin:%s_%s_change' % (\n   208\t            remote_field.model._meta.app_label,\n   209\t            remote_field.model._meta.model_name,\n   210\t        )\n```\n\nIf `remote_field` is the ForeignKey object, `remote_field.model` is indeed the model where the field is defined (`MainModel`).\n\nBut `remote_obj` passed in is `related_obj` (instance of `RelatedModel`).\n\nSo we are trying to generate a URL for `MainModel` using the PK of `RelatedModel`? That seems wrong.\n\nIf `get_admin_url` is supposed to link to the related object, it should use the related model.\n\nLet's see how `get_admin_url` is called. It is called from `contents` method.\n\n```python\n   217\t    def contents(self):\n   218\t        from django.contrib.admin.templatetags.admin_list import _boolean_icon\n   219\t        field, obj, model_admin = self.field['field'], self.form.instance, self.model_admin\n   220\t        try:\n   221\t            f, attr, value = lookup_field(field, obj, model_admin)\n   222\t        except (AttributeError, ValueError, ObjectDoesNotExist):\n   223\t            result_repr = self.empty_value_display\n   224\t        else:\n                    # ...\n   246\t            if getattr(field, 'remote_field', None) and value:\n   247\t                result_repr = self.get_admin_url(field.remote_field, value)\n```\n\nWait, `field` here is the name of the field (string) or the field object?\nIn `AdminReadonlyField.__init__`:\n```python\n   185\t        self.field = {\n   186\t            'name': class_name,\n                # ...\n   189\t            'field': field,\n```\nSo `self.field['field']` is the field object (e.g. `ForeignKey` instance).\n\nIf `field` is a `ForeignKey`, then `field.remote_field` is the `ManyToOneRel` (or similar) object pointing back? Or pointing to?\n\nIn Django < 2.0, it was `rel`. In newer Django, `remote_field` is used.\n\nIf `field` is `ForeignKey(RelatedModel)`, then `field.remote_field.model` is `RelatedModel`.\n\nLet's verify this in the script.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' >> reproduce_issue.py\n\nprint(\"\\nDebugging field attributes:\")\nfield = MainModel._meta.get_field('related')\nprint(f\"field: {field}\")\nprint(f\"field.model: {field.model}\")\nprint(f\"field.remote_field: {field.remote_field}\")\nprint(f\"field.remote_field.model: {field.remote_field.model}\")\nEOF\n```",
