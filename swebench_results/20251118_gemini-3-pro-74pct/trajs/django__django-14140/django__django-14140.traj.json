Modify the special case to check if the child is a tuple of length 2.\n\nThe PR description mentions \"it's unlikely that anyone is relying on this undocumented behavior\" referring to the special case where single-child Q objects deconstruct into kwargs.\n\nHowever, `Q(x=1)` deconstructing to `kwargs={'x': 1}` is quite nice and readable. If it changes to `args=(('x', 1),)`, it's less readable but functionally equivalent if `Q` constructor handles it.\n\n`Q.__init__` signature:\n```python\n    def __init__(self, *args, _connector=None, _negated=False, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(children=[*args, *sorted(kwargs.items())], connector=_connector, negated=_negated)\n```\n\nIf `Q` is initialized with `Q(('x', 1))`, `args` is `(('x', 1),)`. `children` becomes `[('x', 1)]`.\nIf `Q` is initialized with `Q(x=1)`, `kwargs` is `{'x': 1}`. `children` becomes `[('x', 1)]`.\n\nSo both result in the same `children`. So reconstruction works fine.\n\nThe issue is about `deconstruct()` output stability and backward compatibility.\n\nIf I modify the condition to:\n```python\n        if len(self.children) == 1 and not isinstance(self.children[0], Q) and getattr(self.children[0], \"__len__\", None) and len(self.children[0]) == 2:\n             # ...\n```\nWait, `Exists` object might not have `__len__`. The error is `TypeError: 'Exists' object is not subscriptable`.\n\nIf I check `isinstance(child, tuple)`, that would be safer. The children of `Q` created via kwargs are tuples `(key, value)`.\n\nLet's verify if children created via kwargs are always tuples.\n`sorted(kwargs.items())` returns a list of tuples. So yes.\n\nSo if I change the condition to:\n```python\n        if len(self.children) == 1 and not isinstance(self.children[0], Q) and getattr(self.children[0], 'len', None) == 2:\n```\nNo, tuples don't have `.len` attribute, they have `__len__`. But checking `isinstance(self.children[0], tuple)` seems most appropriate if we want to target the `(key, value)` pairs.\n\nHowever, one could technically pass a list `['x', 1]` as an arg to `Q`.\n`Q(['x', 1])` -> `children=[['x', 1]]`.\n`deconstruct()` currently: `kwargs={'x': 1}`.\nIf I restrict to tuple, `Q(['x', 1])` would deconstruct to `args=(['x', 1],)`.\n\nIs `Q(['x', 1])` valid?\n`Q` accepts `*args`. `children` extends `args`.\nWhen `Q` is used, it is usually processed by `SQLCompiler`.\n`Q` objects are used in `filter()`.\n`filter(Q(x=1))` works.\n`filter(Q(('x', 1)))` works?\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with a script.\n\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > test_q_behavior.py\nfrom django.db.models import Q\n\nq1 = Q(x=1)\nprint(f\"Q(x=1) children: {q1.children}\")\nprint(f\"Q(x=1) deconstruct: {q1.deconstruct()}\")\n\nq2 = Q(('x', 1))\nprint(f\"Q(('x', 1)) children: {q2.children}\")\nprint(f\"Q(('x', 1)) deconstruct: {q2.deconstruct()}\")\n\nq3 = Q(['x', 1])\nprint(f\"Q(['x', 1]) children: {q3.children}\")\nprint(f\"Q(['x', 1]) deconstruct: {q3.deconstruct()}\")\n\ntry:\n    q_reconstructed = Q(*q1.deconstruct()[1], **q1.deconstruct()[2])\n    print(f\"Reconstructed Q(x=1) children: {q_reconstructed.children}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Failed to reconstruct Q(x=1): {e}\")\n\ntry:\n    q2_deconstructed = q2.deconstruct()\n    # If q2 deconstructs to args=(('x', 1),), then *args will be ('x', 1).\n    # Q(('x', 1)) -> children=[('x', 1)]\n    q2_reconstructed = Q(*q2_deconstructed[1], **q2_deconstructed[2])\n    print(f\"Reconstructed Q(('x', 1)) children: {q2_reconstructed.children}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Failed to reconstruct Q(('x', 1)): {e}\")\n\nEOF\n```",

Wait, instructions say \"DO NOT MODIFY: Tests\".
