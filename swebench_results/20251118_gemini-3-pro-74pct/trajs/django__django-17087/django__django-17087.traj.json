      "content": "THOUGHT: It seems `psycopg2` is not installed, which is required for `django.contrib.postgres`. Since I cannot install packages, I should try to mock `ArrayField` or use a different field type if possible, but the issue is specifically about `ArrayField` and nested class method default.\n\nHowever, the issue description says:\n`Class methods from nested classes cannot be used as Field.default.`\n\nThe example uses `ArrayField`, but maybe I can reproduce it with a simpler field, like `CharField` or `JSONField` if available, or just by mocking the `ArrayField` if the issue is in the serializer and not in the field itself.\n\nActually, the issue is about serialization of the `default` argument. The `ArrayField` is just the container. The `default` is passed to `ArrayField`.\n\nIf I can't use `ArrayField` because of missing dependencies, I can try to use a standard field like `CharField` and see if I can pass the nested class method as default. But `ArrayField` takes a list as default, so `CharField` might not be appropriate if the default returns a list. `JSONField` might work.\n\nLet's check if `JSONField` is available without postgres. `django.db.models.JSONField` is available in recent Django versions and works on SQLite.\n\nLet's modify the reproduction script to use `JSONField` instead of `ArrayField`.
