This causes a problem when using Django translation on the value of the Enum object. \nThe problem is that, when the Enum object value get translated to the users language, the old migration files raise an error stating that the Enum does not have the corresponding value. (because the Enum value is translated to another language)\nExample:\nLet say we have this code in models.py:\nfrom enum import Enum\nfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Status(Enum):\n\tGOOD = _('Good') # 'Good' will be translated\n\tBAD = _('Bad') # 'Bad' will be translated\n\tdef __str__(self):\n\t\treturn self.name\nclass Item(models.Model):\n\tstatus = models.CharField(default=Status.GOOD, max_length=128)\nIn the generated migration file, the code will be:\n...\n('status', models.CharField(default=Status('Good'), max_length=128))\n...\nAfter the translation, 'Good' will be translated to another word and it will not be part of the Status Enum class any more, so the migration file will raise the error on the previous line:\nValueError: 'Good' is not a valid Status\nShouldn't the code generated by the migration uses the name of the Status Enum 'GOOD', not the value of it, since it is changeable?\nIt should be:\n('status', models.CharField(default=Status['GOOD'], max_length=128))\nThis will be correct regardless of the translated word\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.

      "content": "THOUGHT: The output looks consistent. `IntEnum` and `auto()` Enums are also serialized using item access by name.\n\nOne potential issue: What if the Enum class is not importable from the module?\nThe existing code used `module` and `enum_class.__name__`. My change uses the same. So if it worked before, it should work now, assuming the Enum class itself is importable.\n\nThe only difference is that before it was instantiating the Enum with the value: `Status('Good')`.\nNow it is accessing the member by name: `Status['GOOD']`.\n\nIf `Status` is available, both should work.\n\nHowever, there is a subtle case. `IntEnum` members are also integers.\nIf I have a model field that expects an integer, and I pass `Number.ONE` as default.\nDjango's `CharField` or `IntegerField` might handle the default value.\n\nIf it's an `IntegerField`, `default=Number.ONE`.\nIn the migration file: `default=Number['ONE']`.\nWhen the migration runs, `Number['ONE']` evaluates to the enum member `Number.ONE`.\nSince `Number.ONE` is an `IntEnum`, it behaves like an int. So `Number.ONE == 1` is true.\nSo this should be fine for `IntegerField` too.\n\nWhat about `CharField` with `choices`?\nIf I use `Status.GOOD` as a default for a `CharField`.\n`Status['GOOD']` evaluates to `Status.GOOD`.\n`Status.GOOD` is an Enum member.\nIf the field expects a string, does `Status.GOOD` behave like a string?\nFor `Enum` (not `str, Enum`), `Status.GOOD` is NOT a string. `Status.GOOD.value` is `'Good'`.\n\nWait, the issue description says:\n```python\nclass Status(Enum):\n\tGOOD = _('Good') # 'Good' will be translated\n\tBAD = _('Bad') # 'Bad' will be translated\n\tdef __str__(self):\n\t\treturn self.name\nclass Item(models.Model):\n\tstatus = models.CharField(default=Status.GOOD, max_length=128)\n```\n\nIf `Status` inherits only from `Enum`, `Status.GOOD` is not a string.\nWhen Django uses the default value, does it call `str()` on it? Or does it use the value?\n\nIf `default=Status.GOOD`, when creating a new object, `item.status` will be `Status.GOOD`.\nWhen saving to DB, Django needs to convert it to a string.\n\nIf `Status` inherits from `str, Enum`, then `Status.GOOD` IS a string.\n\nIn the example provided:\n```python\nclass Status(Enum):\n    ...\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.name\n```\nIt implements `__str__` returning the name.\n\nIf I use `Status['GOOD']` in migration, it evaluates to `Status.GOOD`.\nSo `default=Status.GOOD`.\n\nThe previous serialization was `Status('Good')`.\n`Status('Good')` creates a new instance of `Status` (or returns the existing one) corresponding to value `'Good'`.\nSo `Status('Good')` is `Status.GOOD`.\n\nSo both `Status('Good')` and `Status['GOOD']` evaluate to the same object `Status.GOOD`.\n\nThe problem described is that `'Good'` might change due to translation.\nIf `'Good'` becomes `'Bon'`, then `Status('Good')` will fail because `'Good'` is no longer a valid value for `Status`.\nBut `Status['GOOD']` will work because the name `GOOD` stays the same.\n\nSo the fix seems correct and robust against value changes.\n\nI should check if there are any existing tests for migration serialization that I might have broken.\nI'll look for tests in `tests/migrations/test_serializer.py` or similar.\n\n```bash\nfind tests -name \"*serializer*\"\n```",

                "content": "THOUGHT: The output looks consistent. `IntEnum` and `auto()` Enums are also serialized using item access by name.\n\nOne potential issue: What if the Enum class is not importable from the module?\nThe existing code used `module` and `enum_class.__name__`. My change uses the same. So if it worked before, it should work now, assuming the Enum class itself is importable.\n\nThe only difference is that before it was instantiating the Enum with the value: `Status('Good')`.\nNow it is accessing the member by name: `Status['GOOD']`.\n\nIf `Status` is available, both should work.\n\nHowever, there is a subtle case. `IntEnum` members are also integers.\nIf I have a model field that expects an integer, and I pass `Number.ONE` as default.\nDjango's `CharField` or `IntegerField` might handle the default value.\n\nIf it's an `IntegerField`, `default=Number.ONE`.\nIn the migration file: `default=Number['ONE']`.\nWhen the migration runs, `Number['ONE']` evaluates to the enum member `Number.ONE`.\nSince `Number.ONE` is an `IntEnum`, it behaves like an int. So `Number.ONE == 1` is true.\nSo this should be fine for `IntegerField` too.\n\nWhat about `CharField` with `choices`?\nIf I use `Status.GOOD` as a default for a `CharField`.\n`Status['GOOD']` evaluates to `Status.GOOD`.\n`Status.GOOD` is an Enum member.\nIf the field expects a string, does `Status.GOOD` behave like a string?\nFor `Enum` (not `str, Enum`), `Status.GOOD` is NOT a string. `Status.GOOD.value` is `'Good'`.\n\nWait, the issue description says:\n```python\nclass Status(Enum):\n\tGOOD = _('Good') # 'Good' will be translated\n\tBAD = _('Bad') # 'Bad' will be translated\n\tdef __str__(self):\n\t\treturn self.name\nclass Item(models.Model):\n\tstatus = models.CharField(default=Status.GOOD, max_length=128)\n```\n\nIf `Status` inherits only from `Enum`, `Status.GOOD` is not a string.\nWhen Django uses the default value, does it call `str()` on it? Or does it use the value?\n\nIf `default=Status.GOOD`, when creating a new object, `item.status` will be `Status.GOOD`.\nWhen saving to DB, Django needs to convert it to a string.\n\nIf `Status` inherits from `str, Enum`, then `Status.GOOD` IS a string.\n\nIn the example provided:\n```python\nclass Status(Enum):\n    ...\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.name\n```\nIt implements `__str__` returning the name.\n\nIf I use `Status['GOOD']` in migration, it evaluates to `Status.GOOD`.\nSo `default=Status.GOOD`.\n\nThe previous serialization was `Status('Good')`.\n`Status('Good')` creates a new instance of `Status` (or returns the existing one) corresponding to value `'Good'`.\nSo `Status('Good')` is `Status.GOOD`.\n\nSo both `Status('Good')` and `Status['GOOD']` evaluate to the same object `Status.GOOD`.\n\nThe problem described is that `'Good'` might change due to translation.\nIf `'Good'` becomes `'Bon'`, then `Status('Good')` will fail because `'Good'` is no longer a valid value for `Status`.\nBut `Status['GOOD']` will work because the name `GOOD` stays the same.\n\nSo the fix seems correct and robust against value changes.\n\nI should check if there are any existing tests for migration serialization that I might have broken.\nI'll look for tests in `tests/migrations/test_serializer.py` or similar.\n\n```bash\nfind tests -name \"*serializer*\"\n```",
