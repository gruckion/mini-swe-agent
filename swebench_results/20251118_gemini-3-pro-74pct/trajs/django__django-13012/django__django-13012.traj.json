The `GROUP BY` logic is probably in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` or `django/db/models/sql/query.py` (though `compiler.py` is usually where SQL generation happens).\n\nFirst, I want to create a reproduction script to confirm the bug. I need to set up a minimal Django environment, define a model, and run the query described in the issue. The issue description mentions `ExpressionWrapper(expr, output_field=IntegerField())` where `expr` is `Value(3)`.\n\nI'll start by creating a reproduction script `reproduce_issue.py`. I'll need to configure settings in the script since there's no settings module available by default. I'll use an in-memory SQLite database for simplicity, although the issue report mentions Postgres. If the issue is about generating SQL with a constant in GROUP BY, SQLite might handle it differently or throw a different error, or just allow it. The issue report says \"in Postgres, the query above is invalid: aggregate functions are not allowed in GROUP BY\". Wait, the error says \"aggregate functions are not allowed in GROUP BY\". But the query is `SELECT ... GROUP BY \"model\".\"column_a\", 3`. `3` is not an aggregate function. Ah, the error message in the description says:\n`django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: aggregate functions are not allowed in GROUP BY`\n`LINE 1: SELECT \"model\".\"column_a\", 3 AS \"expr_res\", SUM(\"model\".\"col...`\n\nWait, `3` is a constant. Why does Postgres think it's an aggregate function?

GROUP BY X`.\n\nThe only concern is if `ExpressionWrapper` had some side effect on SQL which it doesn't seem to have.\n\nLet's confirm `ExpressionWrapper` doesn't override `as_sql` in a way that differs from `expression.as_sql` EXCEPT delegating.\nYes:\n```python\n    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection):\n        return self.expression.as_sql(compiler, connection)\n```\n\nSo `ExpressionWrapper` is identical to `expression` in terms of SQL generation.\nSo `get_group_by_cols` should definitely reflect `expression`.\n\nLet's apply the fix.\n\n```bash\nsed -i '871i\\\n\\\n    def get_group_by_cols(self, alias=None):\\\n        return self.expression.get_group_by_cols(alias=alias)' django/db/models/expressions.py\n```\n\nWait, line 871 is inside `__repr__`?

When we group by `ExpressionWrapper(expr)`, do we group by `expr`?\nYes, `ExpressionWrapper` usually doesn't change the SQL generation (except possibly casting or something handled by `output_field` but here `as_sql` just delegates to `self.expression.as_sql`).\nWait, if `ExpressionWrapper` had its own SQL generation (e.g. `CAST(expr AS type)`), then delegating `get_group_by_cols` to inner expression might be incorrect if the wrapper modifies the value.\n\nHowever, `ExpressionWrapper.as_sql` is:\n```python\n    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection):\n        return self.expression.as_sql(compiler, connection)\n```\nIt purely delegates SQL generation to the inner expression. The `output_field` is used mainly for Django internals (to know python type of result) or maybe by the inner expression if it uses `_output_field_or_none`.\n\nWait, if `ExpressionWrapper` is initialized with `output_field`, `self.expression` might not have it set. `ExpressionWrapper` sets `self.output_field`.\nDoes `self.expression.as_sql` use `self.output_field`? No, it uses `self.expression.output_field` (or equivalent).\n\nIf `ExpressionWrapper` affects how the SQL is generated (e.g. by causing a cast via `resolve_expression` logic elsewhere?), then we should be careful.\nBut `ExpressionWrapper` seems to rely on `self.expression` to generate SQL.\n\nIf `self.expression` is `Value(3)`, `Value(3).as_sql` generates `3` (or `%s` with parameter 3).\n`Value(3).get_group_by_cols` returns `[]`.\n\nIf `ExpressionWrapper.get_group_by_cols` delegates to `self.expression`, it returns `[]`.\nThen `GROUP BY` clause will not contain `ExpressionWrapper(Value(3))` nor `Value(3)`.\n\nIf we have `ExpressionWrapper(F('column'))`, `F('column').get_group_by_cols` returns `[F('column')]` (roughly).\nIf `ExpressionWrapper` delegates, it returns `[F('column')]`.\nThen the query will group by `column`. `SELECT column FROM ... GROUP BY column`. This is correct.\n\nIs there any case where `ExpressionWrapper` *should* be in GROUP BY but inner expression *should not* or vice-versa?\nSince `ExpressionWrapper` identifies identically to `expression` in SQL (via `as_sql`), its grouping behavior should match `expression`.\n\nOne detail: `get_group_by_cols` returns a list of expressions. If `ExpressionWrapper(F('col'))` returns `[F('col')]`, then the compiler will put `F('col')` in GROUP BY.\nBut the select list might contain `ExpressionWrapper(F('col'))`.\nIf `ExpressionWrapper(F('col'))` generates exactly same SQL as `F('col')`, then grouping by `F('col')` is fine.\n\nHowever, `ExpressionWrapper` is explicitly designed to \"provide extra context to the inner expression, such as the output_field\".\nIf `output_field` implies a data type change that requires SQL syntax (like `CAST`), does `ExpressionWrapper` handle it?\nNo, `ExpressionWrapper` itself doesn't seem to inject `CAST`.\n\nIf I look at `resolve_expression`:\n\n```python\n    def resolve_expression(self, query=None, allow_joins=True, reuse=None, summarize=False, for_save=False):\n        c = super().resolve_expression(query, allow_joins, reuse, summarize, for_save)\n        c.for_save = for_save\n        return c\n```\nWait, I'm looking at `Value` above. `ExpressionWrapper` doesn't implement `resolve_expression`, so it uses `Expression.resolve_expression`.\n\n```python\n    def resolve_expression(self, query=None, allow_joins=True, reuse=None, summarize=False, for_save=False):\n        if self.output_field is None:\n             if hasattr(self.expression, 'output_field'):\n                 self.output_field = self.expression.output_field\n        ...\n```\nWait, `Expression` doesn't have generic `resolve_expression` that sets `output_field` from inner expression because `Expression` doesn't have `expression` attribute generally.\n\nLet's look at `ExpressionWrapper` methods again.

This is identical.\n\nIf `self.expression` is `Value`, it returns `[]`.\nPreviously `[ExpressionWrapper(Value)]` -> `GROUP BY Value`.\nNow `[]` -> No `GROUP BY`.\nThis is exactly the fix required.\n\nIf `self.expression` is `Random()`. `Random()` is an expression. `Random` function doesn't have `get_group_by_cols` usually so it uses `Expression` default `[self]`.\n`ExpressionWrapper(Random())` -> `[Random()]`.\n`Random()` -> `RANDOM()`.\nSQL: `GROUP BY RANDOM()`.\nThis seems correct (if one groups by random, which is weird but consistent).\n\nWait, `ExpressionWrapper` delegates `get_group_by_cols`.\nWhat if `self.expression` is `None`?\n`ExpressionWrapper` takes `expression` in `__init__`.\n`set_source_expressions` sets `self.expression`.\nIt assumes `self.expression` is an expression object.\n\nThe only edge case is if `ExpressionWrapper` is used in a context where `get_group_by_cols` expects something else, but `get_group_by_cols` is standard API for expressions.\n\nOne thing: `ExpressionWrapper` documentation says \"An expression that can wrap another expression so that it can provide extra context to the inner expression, such as the output_field.\"\n\nIf `ExpressionWrapper` is used to wrap an aggregate, e.g. `ExpressionWrapper(Sum('field'), output_field=FloatField())`.\n`Sum` is an aggregate. `Sum.contains_aggregate` is True.\n`ExpressionWrapper.contains_aggregate` checks source expressions.\n`Expression` implementation of `contains_aggregate`:\n```python\n    @property\n    def contains_aggregate(self):\n        return any(expr.contains_aggregate for expr in self.get_source_expressions())\n```\nSo `ExpressionWrapper(Sum(...)).contains_aggregate` is True.\n`Expression.get_group_by_cols` implementation:\n```python\n    def get_group_by_cols(self, alias=None):\n        if not self.contains_aggregate:\n            return [self]\n        cols = []\n        for source in self.get_source_expressions():\n            cols.extend(source.get_group_by_cols())\n        return cols\n```\nIf I didn't override `get_group_by_cols`:\n`ExpressionWrapper(Sum(...))` -> `contains_aggregate` is True.\nIt calls `get_source_expressions()`, which returns `[Sum(...)]`.\nCalls `Sum(...).get_group_by_cols()`.\n`Sum` inherits from `Aggregate`. `Aggregate` inherits from `Func` -> `Expression`.\n`Sum` is aggregate, so `contains_aggregate` is True?\nWait, `Aggregate` class overrides `contains_aggregate` to return `True` (usually).\nActually `Aggregate` in `django/db/models/aggregates.py`.\n\nIf `Sum` contains aggregate, `get_group_by_cols` iterates source expressions of `Sum`. `Sum('field')` source is `F('field')`.\n`F('field').get_group_by_cols` -> `[F('field')]`.\nSo `ExpressionWrapper(Sum('field'))` returns `[F('field')]`.\n\nWith my override:\n`ExpressionWrapper.get_group_by_cols` calls `self.expression.get_group_by_cols`.\n`self.expression` is `Sum(...)`.\n`Sum(...).get_group_by_cols` returns `[F('field')]`.\n\nSo the behavior is identical for aggregates too.\n\nIt seems my change is safe because `ExpressionWrapper` relies on `Expression.get_group_by_cols` logic which iterates over source expressions when `contains_aggregate` is True. `ExpressionWrapper` has `self.expression` as its single source expression.\nThe default `Expression.get_group_by_cols` does:\n1. If not aggregate: returns `[self]`.\n2. If aggregate: recurse into source expressions.\n\nFor `ExpressionWrapper(Value(3))`:\n`contains_aggregate` is False.\nDefault `get_group_by_cols` returns `[self]`. -> `GROUP BY 3`. (ISSUE)\n\nMy override: calls `self.expression.get_group_by_cols`.\n`Value(3).get_group_by_cols` returns `[]`. -> No GROUP BY. (FIX)\n\nFor `ExpressionWrapper(Sum(...))`:\n`contains_aggregate` is True.\nDefault `get_group_by_cols` -> recurse into source (`Sum`). -> `[col]`.\nMy override -> calls `Sum.get_group_by_cols`. -> `[col]`.\nIdentical.\n\nSo the change only affects non-aggregate expressions wrapped in `ExpressionWrapper`.\nAnd specifically, it delegates the decision of \"what are my group by columns\" to the wrapped expression, instead of assuming \"I am the group by column\".\nSince `ExpressionWrapper` is transparent in SQL generation (`as_sql` delegates), it should also be transparent in `get_group_by_cols`.\n\nOne detail: `alias`.\n`get_group_by_cols(self, alias=None)`.\nI am passing `alias` through.\n`return self.expression.get_group_by_cols(alias=alias)`.\nThis is correct.\n\nI am ready to submit.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```"
