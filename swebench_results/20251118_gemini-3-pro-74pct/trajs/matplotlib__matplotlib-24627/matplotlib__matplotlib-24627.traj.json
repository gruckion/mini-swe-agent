But if for some reason it's not, maybe I shouldn't touch it?\nBut `_children` implies ownership.\n\nAlso, `artist.figure` should be `None`?\nYes, if it's removed from the axes, it's removed from the figure (unless it's added to another axes, but here we are just clearing the axes).\n\nWait, `Artist.remove()` sets `self.figure = None`.\nBut `Artist.remove()` also checks `if self.figure:`.\n\nThe PR description says: \"cla(), clf() should unset the `.axes` and `.figure` attributes of deparented artists\".\n\nSo I will proceed with the plan.\n\nI'll create a temporary python script to apply the changes using `sed` or just rewrite the file. Since the insertion is a block of code, `sed` might be tricky with newlines.
